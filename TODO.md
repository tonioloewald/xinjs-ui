# TODO

## From the 1.9.0 nine-lens review (deferred — the blockers and easy fixes are done)

Full report: [RELEASE-REVIEW-1.9.md](RELEASE-REVIEW-1.9.md). Fixed already: 3 blockers,
the lint/typecheck gates, `touch()`, the red-tsc site discard, port defaults,
per-project `remotePort`, the deploy asset path, the mutating smoke test, and the stale
security prose. What is left:

- [ ] **Hybrid lane: Playwright launches the browser, haltija drives it.** VERIFIED
      2026-08-12 — the haltija widget attaches and connects in **WebKit and Firefox**, not
      just Chromium. Loaded our dev server (with `haltijaDev`) in Playwright-launched
      webkit and firefox; both printed `🧝 Haltija connected` / `[haltija] Injected`. The
      loader is a plain dynamic `import()` of an ES module, so there is nothing
      engine-specific in it. haltija's README row "Cross-browser: ⚠️ Chromium only"
      describes the browser it SPAWNS, not the widget's reach — worth telling them, since
      it understates the product.

      This gets both properties: engine coverage from Playwright's binaries, and a driving
      layer that is **ours to fix** when it flakes — which is the whole argument, given the
      current `segmented.pw.ts` flake is Playwright's actionability check rather than our
      component. Caveat before migrating: attachment is proven, per-verb parity is not.
      Exercise click, type and `map` on WebKit first; anything that misbehaves is a haltija
      fix rather than a blocker.

- [ ] **(superseded by the above, kept for the evidence) Moving interaction tests to haltija wholesale.**
      The instinct is right: when a harness flakes, owning it beats trusting it, and
      haltija has turned reports around in a day. But haltija is **Chromium only**
      (Electron, or headless via Playwright _Chromium_), so the move would drop firefox and
      webkit entirely — and `doc-tests.pw.ts` explicitly calls two engines "a real gate",
      noting that _"the old haltija lane only ever drove one Chromium-based engine, so
      WebKit doc-tests never ran at all"_. Moving back would undo a deliberate improvement.

      The evidence splits the two engines, though:

      - **firefox** is load-bearing — it runs the whole doc-test tier green alongside
        chromium, and is the only non-Chromium signal we have.
      - **webkit** is already skipped for the doc-test tier (#19, its iframe runner never
        signals completion), has no source commit attributable to a webkit-specific bug,
        and is where the click flake concentrates.

      So the shape worth considering is narrower than "move it to haltija": keep Playwright
      for cross-engine coverage, drop or quarantine **webkit** for interaction specs where
      it is producing flakes rather than findings, and use haltija for what it is uniquely
      good at — agent-driven inspection of a real page. Decide it as a coverage question,
      not as a reaction to a flake.

- [ ] **The haltija doc-test lane reports 34 where Playwright reports 37.** Measured
      2026-08-12, same corpus, same engine family: `bun playwright test` prints
      chromium 37 / firefox 37 / webkit 34, while `bun run test-browser` (haltija,
      Chromium) prints 34. **Zero failures in either** — three pages are not being reached,
      not failing. Ruled out: the last-good fallback (v1.9.6 also gives 34) and asset
      compression (disabling it still gives 34). Most likely the background runner's
      per-page budget under haltija's slower rAF, since the runner iframes each
      page-with-tests in turn. Worth pinning the expected count so a silent drop cannot
      pass as green — a lane that reports "34 passed / 0 failed" looks identical whether
      three tests were skipped or never existed.

- [x] **FIXED 2026-08-13 — `segmented.pw.ts` click timeouts on webkit/firefox.**
      Symptom: intermittently 1–4 failures in a full `bun playwright test`, always
      `locator.click: Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded`, never in CI (chromium only).

      **Cause — and it was neither theory recorded here.** Playwright's retry log named the
      blocker outright: the element is "visible, enabled and stable", and the click is
      refused because `<span part="label">Running</span> from <tosi-doc-system> subtree
      intercepts pointer events`. Not the segmented highlight failing to settle
      (the animation-stability guess), and not the doc-runner changes in 1.9.7 (verified by
      reverting the census gate and reproducing anyway).

      Both tests appended their repro element plainly to `document.body`, so it landed at the
      **bottom of the page** — exactly where the doc-site's test-status badge is pinned
      (`position: fixed; bottom; left; z-index: 1000`). Playwright scrolled the fixture into
      view, put it under the badge, and retried until timeout. That is also why it correlated
      with load: the badge reads "Running" for as long as the background doc-test runner
      works, which is longer on a busy machine — the overlap was always there, the badge just
      lingered long enough to be hit.

      Fix: the fixtures are pinned `position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; z-index: 2000`, above
      the chrome. The click stays a real pointer click with all actionability checks intact —
      the fixture simply is not under an unrelated overlay. Explicitly **not** `force: true`,
      which would have masked a genuine un-clickable state.

      Verified: 6/6 clean runs of the spec on firefox+webkit, and **3/3 clean full-suite runs
      at 59/59** (the configuration that used to lose 2–4). Also corrects the earlier claim
      that it "passes 3/3 in isolation" — it reproduced in isolation too.

      Left alone deliberately: the badge itself. A fixed corner badge legitimately owns its
      corner, and it is a real `<button>` opening the test menu, so making it transparent to
      pointer events (as this entry previously suggested) would break it to fix a test's
      fixture placement.

**From snowfox's build-system reports (deferred — the cheap halves are done):**

- [ ] **[#56](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-ui/issues/56) — label build-only
      advisories in the audit verdict.** NOT a change to what blocks: blocking on every
      high+ regardless of dep class is a deliberate decision (a compromised linter has your
      source, credentials and shell), and the time-boxed `audit.allow` gate is the intended
      release valve. The additive half is worth it — the gate already annotates _nature_
      (`LEAK/ALTER` / `DoS-only`), so adding _reach_ lets a reader judge whether a red build
      is proportionate. Deferred because it is a `bun.lock` + workspace-manifest walk, not a
      flag — snowfox says so themselves — and a classifier that mislabels a runtime dep as
      build-only is worse than none. Advisory labelling first; policy only if it earns it.
      They offered a write-up of their reachability walk; take it before implementing.
- [ ] **[#58](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-ui/issues/58) — CodeMirror's 12 hard
      deps.** Cost documented in CLAUDE.md rather than fixed. Revisit only if a CodeMirror
      advisory actually fails an adopter's build; the exit is extracting `<tosi-code>` into
      its own package, which is a breaking change and needs a reason.

**Post-1.9.0 — adopt more of haltija (1.6.1–1.11.0):**

- [ ] **Expose `globalThis.tosiAgent`** so `hj map` carries binding provenance instead of
      reconstructing from the DOM. haltija's map output names this seam explicitly, and it
      is the general answer to their (now-closed) #10: agents currently drive our
      live-example menu via `button.source-menu → .xin-menu-item`, which breaks every time
      we restyle it. Surface toggle-source / refresh / set-code as wiring rather than
      selectors.

- [ ] **Replace the hand-rolled wait loop with `hj doctor`.** We adopted the `ready` field
      but not the command built for this: it exits non-zero and checks reachable → tab
      connected → target unambiguous → tabs-not-all-hidden → version skew, _in the order
      they bite_, with `--json` for machine use. haltija's `CI-INTEGRATION.md` now shows it
      as the wait-loop condition, replacing exactly the DIY loop we still have. Also
      `--strict`/`HALTIJA_STRICT=1` turns their advisory warnings into non-zero exits, so
      a lane fails on the real cause instead of a downstream symptom.
- [ ] **`hj map` instead of `hj tree` for driving live examples** (relates to haltija#10).
      Structural and deterministic — no font/theme/viewport/animation variance — and a few
      hundred bytes vs ~1–1.5k vision tokens for a screenshot. It also degrades honestly
      against our rAF limitation: if nothing painted, the map is empty rather than
      plausible.
- [ ] **`hj screenshot --canvas`** for any WebGL/canvas doc example — real pixels, no
      screen-share grant, works with the tab backgrounded. Mostly a tosijs-3d win; worth
      telling them. It also warns on the `preserveDrawingBuffer` blank-image trap rather
      than returning an empty picture.

**Post-1.9.0:**

- [ ] **[#40](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-ui/issues/40) — generate the per-icon
      modules from canonical data.** `src/icons/data/*` (313 modules) is the fine-grained
      tree-shakeable surface, which is a real feature — but it's a frozen 2024 snapshot no
      generator maintains: 47 have drifted from `icon-data.ts` (24 froze pre-redirect, 23
      differ in SVG content) and `pin` has no module at all. Generate them at build time
      instead, **resolving redirects when emitting** (`arrowUp` is the redirect string
      `arrowRight270r` in canon, so a naive emit would ship a token where markup is
      expected). Emitting to `dist/` directly would also drop 314 files from `src/`.
      Not carrying the #30 `fill-rule` bug — verified.

**From the THIRD 1.9.0 review round (pass 2 follow-ups not yet done):**

- [ ] **Integration test that the tunnel listener is handed `viaTunnel = true`.** The
      fail-open shipped through beta.1/2 and rc.1/2 because the decision was inline in the
      server closure. Extraction made the _predicate_ testable; the call site still isn't,
      and flipping `true`→`false` at `dev-server.ts:1245` is unobservable by every lane
      (`testMode` and `DEV_NO_TUNNEL=1` both skip the bind). Export a
      `createRequestHandler` factory so both bindings are assertable without TLS.
- [ ] **`tosijs-tunnel`: ask the host for the remote port, and register the route AFTER
      the forward succeeds.** `derivePort` is FNV-1a into 900 slots with no occupancy
      check, while `site-config.ts` (shipped in `dist/*.d.ts`) and `doc-site-system.md`
      both promise two projects "can't collide". The fragment write + `systemctl reload`
      run _before_ `ssh -R`, so a collision leaves B's public hostname routing at A's live
      workspace, with no `--unregister`. **Soften the shipped claim to "collisions are
      detected and refused" — it is another guarantee the code does not provide.**
- [ ] `bin/make-icon-data.js` — one bare `catch {}` covers "prettier not installed", a
      prettier _parse_ error, and an API change, so a malformed generated module is
      written and reported as "Successfully generated" with exit 0. Split it: silent
      fallback only for module resolution. Also escape `\r`/`\t` in `quote()` (a raw
      control byte makes grep silently lie), and move `quote`/`emitObject` into `src/`
      where `bun test` can reach them.

**Before the 1.9.0 tag:**

- [ ] Write a consolidated `## 1.9.0` CHANGELOG section, leading with the **consumer
      repairs**, not remote editing — 1.8.0's `tosijs-ui/site` does not import at all in a
      clean install (`index.js` re-exports `devServer`, which top-level-imports `chokidar`,
      a devDependency), and 1.8.0 is still npm `latest`. Say plainly that anyone on 1.8.0
      should upgrade regardless. Name the issues closed.
- [ ] Close the 13 already-fixed issues naming their version: **v1.9.0** — #27 (partially),
      #28–#37; **v1.8.0** — #24; **v1.7.2** — #25 (open two cycles). Close #3 as stale. Leave
      #9/#12/#14/#16/#17/#18/#19/#21/#23 open with "considered, deferred for 1.9.0".
- [ ] Refresh `UPSTREAM.md`: tosijs#20 and #21 are CLOSED upstream (2026-07-27) but still
      listed open; three "still pinned 1.7.5" statements contradict `package.json` (1.7.8);
      the rAF entry should name haltija#3 (filed + closed) instead of "NOT YET FILED"; add
      the five open tosijs issues absent from the file (#22, #18, #17, #16, #9).
- [ ] #27 is only **half** closed — the bins ship, but the host-side bootstrap
      (`preview_site`/`tunnel_site` snippets, `preview.env`, `build-index.sh`) is still
      "copy it out of the tosijs-ui repo", so an adopter's `tosijs-deploy --go` writes a
      fragment referencing an undefined snippet and `caddy validate` fails forever. Ship a
      bootstrap bin or document the prerequisite and name it in the failure message.

**Correctness / coverage (not blocking):**

- [ ] `buildStatus` never reflects the INITIAL build (`dev-server.ts`) — it is initialised
      `{ok:true}` and only written by the watch debounce, while `bin/dev.ts` runs the first
      build itself. Start `bun start` on a red tree and the restored last-good site serves
      with no failure widget until the first save. Needs an `initialBuild` seam.
- [ ] Extract and unit-test `stashLastGood()` / `restoreLastGood()` — `rm -rf` + `mv` over a
      committed directory with no test at any tier, and it already regressed once inside
      this cycle. Two known gaps: the `mkdir -p ${PUBLIC}` sits _outside_ the `try`, and a
      stranded `docs.last-good` survives a later successful build when `docs/` was absent.
- [ ] The client auth-aware save/edit paths — including the 403→download **data-loss** fix —
      have no test at any tier. `src/coverage.test.ts` already builds a doc-browser under
      happy-dom; add stubbed-fetch cases (403 → alert, no download; 501 → download; 200 →
      new baseline) and the `loadSource` 401/403 case.
- [ ] Add `bun run test-consumer` to CI — it needs only network and a temp dir (no certs,
      no display, no haltija), and this repo's own docs say an ungated lane always rots.
- [ ] Fold the six copy-pasted `server.stop(); process.exit(…)` sites into one `shutdown()`.

**Shared practices (`tosijs-coding-practices`):**

- [ ] `practices/deployment.md` still prescribes Caddy `basicauth` and asserts the box has
      "no write endpoint" — the design 1.9.0 rejected, on a box that now fronts an
      authenticated tunnel exposing `POST /__docstore/source`. Update it, add the
      view-vs-edit hostname convention, and note `requireToken` defaults `true`.
      (`grep -rn tunnel practices/*.md` currently returns zero hits.)
- [ ] Add a **packaging-verification** practice: `releasing.md` → "audit the tarball before
      you publish" (`npm pack --dry-run`, compare file count/size to the previous release,
      assert every bin has a shebang, grep for cwd-relative package-asset resolution);
      `testing.md` → a pack-and-install smoke lane naming `bin/smoke-consumer.ts`. Four
      packaging regressions reached published prereleases; more unit tests would have caught
      none — the gap was context, not depth.
- [ ] Update the practices README scoreboard (still says tosijs-ui 1.7.1, three releases
      stale) and add "update the scoreboard" to this repo's Publishing checklist.

**Smaller / unverified leads** — see the report's "Unverified leads" list; notable ones:
the mid-build 404 window (fall back to `.last-good` in `resolveFile`), a
`tosijs-ui/site/config` subpath so the bins don't pull the whole build graph,
`tosijs-tunnel --close` killing `pgrep` matches with no identity confirmation, and
`deploy/` shipping with `dev.tosijs.net` / a personal email hardcoded and no adopter
substitution guide.

## Test fences as a first-class tier — the five gaps (#142)

From tosijs-3d-ensemble converting a bespoke Playwright lane to test fences. The report is
worth reading in full; the promotion case is a **decision**, but five items under it are
concrete work and are listed here so they don't live only in the issue.

The reporter's own framing, which we should keep: fences replace the **browser lane**, not
`bun test`. Anything that is a function stays in the fast happy-dom tier (theirs: 405 tests in
~1.0s vs 4 fences in ~5s plus a build).

- [ ] **Thin matcher set.** No `toBeCloseTo`, so everything renderer-shaped (intensities,
      bounding boxes, densities) gets hand-rolled as `Math.round(x * 1e6) / 1e6`.
      `toBeCloseTo` and `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual` would cover most of it.
- [ ] **Concurrency vs WebGL contexts.** Test bodies run concurrently and same-page examples
      overlap; Chrome hard-caps live WebGL contexts near 16 and force-loses the oldest. A doc
      page with several 3D examples is a context-eviction hazard whose symptom is an unrelated
      flaky test. Wants a per-page serial mode or an opt-in serial marker. Nobody has been bitten
      yet — one example per page — so this is a designed-in cliff, not luck that ran out.
- [ ] **Two unmarked fence-authoring traps**, one line of docs each: a block comment inside a
      fence ends the enclosing doc comment at its first close token (their *warning about this*
      broke its own file by spelling the token out), and a fence has its own import scope so the
      example's imports are not available in it.
- [ ] **Line numbers may be computed against the wrong source.** Two failures in two *different*
      test blocks both reported `(line 114)`. Unchased and possibly an artifact of how that fence
      was built — but if the offset is wrong the number is worse than none, because it sends you
      confidently to the wrong place. Someone who knows `firstUserStackFrame` should look.
      **Relevant to us beyond that repo:** this release already fixed one doc-test false green,
      and a wrong line number is the same class of defect — the lane reporting something it
      cannot back up.
- [ ] **Page-level behaviour has nowhere to go** (their editor races its own `src` against an
      explicit `load()`). Fine in itself, but it means the browser lane does not go to zero and
      a promotion pitch should say so.

### The structural-diff idea, and what the DOM side needs (#142, 2026-09-06)

The strongest thing in the thread, from tosijs-3d-ensemble: **fuzzy-match the STRUCTURE instead
of comparing images.** They built `sceneFloorplan()` / `floorplanDiff(a, b, epsilon)` for 3D;
the DOM parallel is `describe().wiring` (structure, precise) beside `schematicSVG` →
`rasterizeSVG` (picture, at a glance). Both substrates get both, and neither structure is
cosmetic — which is what makes fuzzy matching meaningful rather than a threshold you tune.

Verified against the shipped `tosijs/agent` types: `AgentWiringRecord` already carries `bounds`,
`viewportFixed`, `structural` and optional `style`; `schematicSVG`/`rasterizeSVG`/`boundsOf` are
exported; and **`auditAccessibility` is already the "snapshot in a fence, verdict as a pure
function over plain data" split** ensemble proposed. A DOM differ is the second instance of an
existing pattern here, not a new one.

Analysis worth keeping (full version in the issue thread):

- [ ] **Absent/added and moved/resized are different questions**, not three points on a scale.
      The first is identity, the second is geometry, and only the second takes a tolerance. This
      is the actual defect in pixel diffing — a heat map cannot separate "gone" from "moved 1px",
      so one threshold has to answer both and answers neither.
- [ ] **Pair by BINDING PATH, count where there is none.** DOM is ahead of 3D here: a record's
      `value ⟷ app.user.name` is intrinsic and survives re-render and reorder, so a failure can
      name the Save button. Two nearby keys are wrong — the wiring **index is documented as not
      surviving re-renders**, and `ref` is producer-supplied so it is absent when nobody is
      driving. For `list` bindings `idPath` is the same key one level down, which is also the
      honest answer to ensemble's repeat-counting problem.
- [ ] **Distinguish *not in the map* from *in the map with zero area*.** Zero-size bounds means
      "not visible", which overloads a deleted element with a collapsed one — different
      diagnoses, and a naive differ calls both `GONE`. This is the DOM twin of the draw-order
      bug ensemble caught: one line, and it fails in the direction that looks like a finding.
      **Cheap and worth doing regardless of whether the tier gets promoted.**
- [ ] **Write down the settle asymmetry before anyone unifies it.** `settled(predicate)` belongs
      in the harness and is universal; `nextFrame()` belongs to the substrate and is a claim
      about someone else's scheduler. rAF is correct for tosijs (the render pipeline is
      rAF-driven) and wrong for Babylon (`onBeforeRenderObservable` fires after rAF — it shifted
      manta-recon's results by one row and looked like a real finding). A shared helper would be
      right for one and silently wrong for the other. **Also cheap, also independent of the RFC.**
- [ ] **A snapshot must record its viewport and scroll offset, and a diff across differing
      offsets is a comparison ERROR, not a finding.** `<tosi-table>` renders only the visible
      window, so for virtualized content scroll position changes which records **exist** — not
      merely where they are. That churn lands in the identity half of the diff, the half that
      takes no tolerance, so the most common enterprise widget would produce the loudest
      possible failure for the least possible reason. The upside of the same fact: DOM
      virtualization already yields a post-culling draw list, so the analogue of
      `getActiveMeshes()` does not have to be built.
- [ ] Scope honestly: this is a layout oracle for **bound** UI. Unwired presentational elements
      are not in the map, and a matcher must say so rather than report "not visible".
- [ ] **"Zero-flash hydration" is an untested claim in our own published docs, and the
      structural diff is the test for it.** `tests/doc-system.pw.ts` checks hydration ADOPTS
      the pre-rendered `<article>` rather than re-rendering it — node identity, better than
      most projects have — but nothing checks whether anything MOVED. A bounds diff across
      hydration is exactly the tri-state: identical = the claim holds; moved/resized = a
      flash, sized in pixels and named by element; absent/added = replaced rather than
      adopted. **This is the first application of the idea that is ours rather than
      hypothetical, and it does not need the RFC settled.** It also could not have come from
      the 3D reports: a renderer has no "before" state — the first frame is the first frame.
- [ ] **Snapshot identity is six fields, not one** — forced open by four consumers, each
      invisible from every vantage but theirs: **viewport**, **scroll offset** (two-dimensional;
      `preserveScroll` anchors the top visible ROW vertically, but `scrollLeft` is a raw pixel
      and is the unstable axis), **filter state**, **library version**, **mount context**, and
      **frame liveness**. A matcher designed from one substrate ships with one of these and
      discovers the rest as flakiness.
- [ ] **Mount context is DOM-only and does not travel** (snowfox). `bounds` is a function of the
      ancestor chain and the host page's globals; `tosi-table` renders light DOM so its cells are
      styled from outside by definition, and a doc-page fence reproduces neither app's cascade.
      A baseline must record where it was mounted (host page + a hash of applicable global
      stylesheets), and a diff across mount contexts is a comparison error. **Corollary with
      teeth: a probe must be a SPECIFICITY TWIN, not merely the same tag** — their empty probe
      button did not match `:not(:empty)` and measured 0 while the real button was 44px.
- [ ] **A rAF-based settle primitive can NEVER RESOLVE on this substrate, not merely resolve
      late.** I asserted the opposite in #142 ("our pipeline is rAF-driven, so rAF is correct"),
      which answers whether the clock ticks with a fact about what it is made of. A starved tab
      reports `visibilityState: 'visible'` while rAF never fires, and `queueRender()` is
      documented as possibly never firing off-screen. Every settle helper needs a frame budget
      and a **distinguishable** timeout — "the frame clock never ticked" is a different diagnosis
      from "the assertion failed".
- [ ] **In a starved tab, geometry is trustworthy but ABSENCE is not** — an element that never
      mounted is indistinguishable from one that should not exist. So the two halves of the diff
      need different *confidence*, not just different tolerances: moved/resized degrades
      gracefully, absent/added does not.
- [ ] **`describe({ styles: true })` should refuse capture from a non-composited tab.** A
      transition that never advances pins its START value, and animations outrank the cascade —
      beating specificity, `!important` and inline styles. With `transition: 0.2s` on every
      control that is the whole interactive surface reporting stale colours as if CSS were
      broken. Tell: `el.getAnimations()` showing a `CSSTransition` at `currentTime: 0,
      playState: 'running'`.
- [ ] **Every primitive must say what it does with nothing to measure, and the answer is never
      "passes."** Two independent reports (tosijs-platform §4, snowfox §4), so this is a rule now.
      Sharpest instance: `enableAgentInterface()` exposes nothing by default — correct posture —
      so a fence that forgets to opt in gets an EMPTY map, over which `not.toBeDrawn()` passes and
      a diff of two empties reports no changes. Snapshot primitives should throw on an empty map
      unless the author passes `{ expectEmpty: true }`.
- [ ] **Get 2D practitioners into #142 before designing the matcher family.** Four things this
      thread structurally cannot supply: lived experience of visual-regression tooling
      (Chromatic/Percy/BackstopJS have fought the snapshot-noise reputation problem
      commercially for a decade); font-loading reflow, which has no 3D analogue and makes DOM
      layout deterministic only given viewport *and* fonts; responsive breakpoints, where one
      page has several correct layouts; and whether the accessibility tree is a better second
      structural projection than `wiring`.

## Fail loudly as a review lens — 25% of the backlog is one defect class (#61)

14 of 56 issues are silent failure. Not a theme anyone went looking for; it is what the corpus
contains. The ask is to adopt it as a **stated design rule and a review lens** rather than
fixing instances: no empty render on a resolution failure, no swallowed exception in the
orchestrator or dev server, no destructive filesystem operation without a guard.

The adoption argument is the part worth keeping: the release loop is fast because the primary
consumer has commit rights on both ends and files within hours. A consumer without that
relationship gets the same regressions and none of the recourse, so they rationally pin and lag
— and the project loses the thing that makes the velocity work.

- [ ] Decide whether this becomes a standing lens (shared practices) or a repo rule here.
- [ ] Three unfiled instances named in the issue: an example whose import is missing from
      `installContext` renders nothing with no console error; the dev server does not watch
      `tosijs-site.config.ts` (sibling of #49); `.doc-content`'s `max-width` is an **inline**
      style, so consumers need `!important` and full-bleed is impossible (#52).

## Doc-System Roadmap

See [doc-system-roadmap.md](doc-system-roadmap.md) for the full plan. North star:
each library is a web-accessible doc-system endpoint (library-as-ESM + docs +
authoring), with **tjs-lang** as the live-example transpiler, the **tosijs-ui doc
system** as build/docs/front-end, and an **AJS-VM universal endpoint** as the
back end. Sequence: `./docs` subpath refactor → #6 tjs+CodeMirror → #5 haltija
widget → #4 edit source → #3 save/load examples → #1 ePub → #2 PDF. Phase-2:
importmap example resolution, versioned endpoints, AJS RestStore.

## Dependency majors — decide, don't drift

Minors and patches are current (`bun outdated` shows Update == Current for everything),
so there is no hygiene backlog. These are **major** jumps, which are decisions rather
than routine upgrades — but per `tosijs-coding-practices/practices/dependencies.md` §11,
letting them sit for years is how a five-minute security pin turns into a forced
migration under time pressure. Tracked so they are chosen, not discovered.

- **`marked` 16 → 18** — highest priority, because it is a **peer dependency**: the
  version consumers install is their problem, so a major we have not tested against is
  a support burden we cannot see. Verify rendering across the doc corpus.
- **`prettier` 2 → 3** — will reformat the entire repo in one commit. Cheap in effort,
  expensive in diff noise; do it alone, never alongside a feature, and ideally right
  after a release so blame stays readable.
- **`typescript` 5 → 7** — check for removed compiler options first. Note the root
  tsconfig already had `downlevelIteration` removed under a newer tsc, so this jump is
  not free.
- **`chokidar` 4 → 5** — the dev server's watcher; test the rebuild-storm detector and
  the ignore list specifically.
- **`@types/node` 22 → 26**, **`@types/jsdom` 21 → 28** — types only, but they can
  surface real errors in a strict build.

## High Priority

### `<tosi-table>` loses FOCUS on re-render (same class as #67)

- [ ] **Focus does not survive a re-render, and it should.** Verified 2026-08-14: focus a
      `.td`, change `filter`, and `document.activeElement` is `<body>`.

      ```
      before: SPAN "row 2"     ← focused cell
      after:  BODY             ← filter changed
      ```

      Same cause as the scroll bug — `render()` does `this.textContent = ''` and destroys the
      state — but a worse symptom: scroll position is where you were *looking*, focus is where
      you were *working*. A keyboard user mid-navigation is dropped out of the table entirely
      and has to tab back in. A desktop list view keeps the focused row focused through a
      re-sort, and this is exactly the bar tosijs-ui is aiming at, so "the mouse still works"
      is not an answer. Invisible to anyone testing with a mouse, which is why it survived
      this long.

      **Migrate, don't just restore.** If the focused row is still present, put focus back on
      the same row/column. If it is GONE — filtered out, or the sort dropped it — focus must
      move to the next logical place rather than vanishing: the nearest surviving row at the
      same column, preferring the row that took its position, falling back to the last row
      when it was the end of the list, and to the table itself when nothing survives. Dropping
      focus to `<body>` is the one outcome that is always wrong.

      The pieces exist: `_pendingFocus` / `focusCell` / `findCell` already do restore-after-
      scroll for keyboard nav, and #67's anchor capture is the same shape (capture before
      teardown, resolve after). Best done in the same pass as the structural fix below — one
      "what was the user doing" capture covering scroll, focus and flicker beats three
      separate anchors bolted onto a teardown.

### `<tosi-table>` scroll preservation — the two parts deliberately NOT done (#67)

Scroll stability across re-render shipped in `601d3ee1` (anchors on the topmost visible row,
`preserveScroll` opts out). Two things #67 raised were considered and left alone **on
purpose**; this is the reasoning, so neither gets re-proposed as an oversight or silently
dropped.

- [ ] **Reuse `.scroll-area` instead of rebuilding it** (#67's "related nicety" — `scrollend`
      is re-bound every render). **Deferred, and the case for it is weaker than it looks.**

      1. It is **not a leak.** Each render builds a new `.scroll-area` and discards the old
         one, which takes its listener with it. #67 is right that the listener count is only
         fine *because* the element is discarded — but it is discarded.
      2. It would **not remove the retry loop**, which is the actual complexity. That loop
         exists because the virtual spacer is sized a frame late, and reuse does not change
         that: at frame 0 the content is one viewport tall (measured below), so the browser
         clamps `scrollTop` to ~0 whether the element is new or reused. Reuse buys the
         *appearance* of a simpler fix without the substance.
      3. The cost lands in the **riskiest place** — `render()` would go from
         `this.textContent = ''` to "preserve one specific child, replace the rest", in the
         most complex component in the library.

      Net: one element allocation and one `addEventListener` per render, against structural
      surgery that fixes no observed defect. Revisit only as part of the flicker fix below,
      where holding scrollable height across the swap would give reuse an actual purpose.

- [ ] **Eliminate the one-frame flicker.** The table paints once at the top before the
      correction lands. **Measured** on a 400-row × 40px table (chromium), sampling each frame
      after a filter change:

      | frame | `scrollHeight` | `scrollTop` |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | 0 | 400 (== `clientHeight`, no spacer yet) | 0 |
      | 1 | 16040 | 4000 |

      So it is exactly one frame (~16ms), self-correcting, and only in virtual mode —
      with `rowHeight: 0` every row is stamped during render, so the height is real at frame
      0 and there is nothing to correct.

      The cheap fix, if it is judged worth it: append a **temporary spacer** of
      `visibleData.length * rowHeight` to `.scroll-area` before the first paint so the
      container is immediately scrollable, write the target `scrollTop`, then drop the spacer
      on the next frame once the real one exists. ~10 lines, confined to virtual mode, and the
      existing retry already re-asserts the position when the spacer is removed.

      The structural fix, which retires this whole class: **stop rebuilding the DOM when only
      the data changed.** `filter` / `sort` / `visibleGroupedRowIds` change what
      `rowData.visible` holds, not the shape of the table — assigning the new array and
      letting `listBinding` reconcile would leave the scroll container untouched, so there is
      no clamp, no retry, and no flicker. Bigger job (the header's sort indicators still need
      a structural update), but it also makes #67's nicety fall out for free.

### Nested live-examples mis-route (self-hosting demo) — CSS half

- [ ] **Tighten the live-example's light-DOM CSS to child combinators** so a container example's
      state classes / part rules don't bleed onto **nested** examples' parts (the
      `one-source-every-artifact` self-hosting demo). E.g. `:host.-test-passed [part="exampleWidgets"]`
      → `:host.-test-passed > [part="example"] > [part="exampleWidgets"]`. The functional half (the
      `this.parts` proxy resolving to a nested instance's parts) is a **tosijs** bug — filed as
      [tonioloewald/tosijs#20](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs/issues/20), see `UPSTREAM.md`;
      the user is fixing it in tosijs. Revisit this CSS half after bumping the tosijs dep with the fix.

### From the 1.7.0-beta.3 nine-lens review (`RELEASE-REVIEW-1.7-beta3.md`)

Full report in that file. Recommendation was **BLOCK** on one finding, now **fixed**:

- [x] **BLOCKER FIXED** — eager static `tjs-lang/editors` import + scope-capture on every reader
      example. Now a dynamic import gated to `dialect!=='js' && editorsBuilt`; optional-peer contract
      restored, scope code is a lazy 1.3KB chunk fetched only at edit-time.

Non-blocking follow-ups (do before the FINAL 1.7.0 tag):

- [x] **CHANGELOG** — added `1.7.0-beta.3` section, fixed the peer line to `^0.10.1`, annotated the
      beta.2 "Remaining… defers construction" note as delivered.
- [x] **CLAUDE.md/MEMORY.md `haltija@latest` → `^1.4.0`** (code pins `HALTIJA_PKG=haltija@^1.4.0`).
- [x] **DECISION MADE (2026-07-20): breaking `<tosi-code>` ships as 1.7.0 MINOR, documented loudly.**
      Rationale: the `2.0` name is reserved for the tjs-native tosijs port. Loud BREAKING notice added
      atop CHANGELOG (new consolidated `## 1.7.0` section) and README (⚠️ section before the intro):
      ACE→CM6, `theme`/`options` dropped with no shim, `value`/`mode`/`change`/`disabled`/undo-redo
      unchanged, pin `@1.6` to defer. **Final tag waits on haltija 1.5.0 (being nine-lensed).**
- [x] **`el.editor` getter warning** — downgraded to `console.info`, leads with "it IS the supported
      CM6 accessor" so correct use isn't scolded.
- [ ] **CI e2e is Chromium-only** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — the headline browser features have no
      automated Firefox/WebKit gate (only the manual local lane, which "rots silently"). Add a Firefox
      project OR a release-checklist step that fails if all-project `bun playwright test` wasn't run.
      Also: the 4 new specs `test.skip` WebKit unconditionally — track that permanent gap.
- [x] **`killStrayServer` kill receipt** — now logs SIGTERM → pid/comm/port (and SIGKILL escalation).
- [ ] **ePub build is non-deterministic** — re-zips with varying bytes, so the build-then-`git diff`
      staleness gate can't be clean. Fixed mtimes/ordering, or exclude the path from the gate.
- [x] **DRY: `gzipSizeInChild`** extracted (orchestrator, was inline ×2).
- [ ] **DRY (remaining):** extract one `runBunChild(argv)` owning the drain-both-pipes invariant
      (orchestrator ×2 + bundle-guard — the leak class this release fights); extract
      `prepareExecutable()` shared by executeInline/Iframe (touches the core run path — do carefully).
- [x] **`demo/src` dead-entry tangle — RESOLVED via option (a).** `<tosi-css-var-editor>` was dead in
      the build (only registered by the un-built `demo/src/index.ts`). Moved it into the doc-system
      (`src/doc-system/css-var-editor.ts`), registered via a side-effect import in `doc-system.ts` (NOT
      a public export), fixed its rgb-color detection + unbounded retry, and deleted the whole dead demo
      entry. Live on the component pages now (verified on /carousel/).
- [x] **#13 `<tosi-map>`** — fixed (one map, not one per render during CDN load) + regression test.
- [x] **#8 hydration console errors** — verified fixed by the 1.6.9 parts adoption, closed, guarded
      (`hydration.pw.ts` console-clean test).
- [x] **#15 ePub cross-links** — fixed (`rewriteInBookLinks`), closed, 6 unit cases + real-ePub verified.
- [~] **GitHub issues + `UPSTREAM.md` (ecosystem), remaining:**
  - [x] #14 (throwing example) already filed + open (tosijs-ui#14) — tracked, not a new filing.
  - [x] **WebKit doc-test-runner skip filed as tosijs-ui#19** (2026-07-20) — the 4 specs that
        `test.skip` WebKit + root cause (iframe runner never posts per-page `tosi-tests-done`).
  - [x] bun#34053 note kept current (weekly poll 2026-07-20; PR still unmerged, still 1.3.14).
  - [ ] **#13 (`<tosi-map>`) — CLOSE ON TAG.** Fixed on-branch (`c7c1e63e`) but the issue is
        still OPEN; close it naming 1.7.0 when the tag lands.
  - [ ] #9 (document the cinematic-landing-page pattern — content-bound). **#12**
        (language-plugin hooks) is strategic platform work, not a cleanup — see the platform
        sequence below.
- [x] **Shared `tosijs-coding-practices` (practices lens) — DONE (2026-07-20).** On review, most were
      already landed by the earlier practices commit: `testing.md` Playwright claim already inverted
      (dedicated 8799, `reuseExistingServer:false`); `00-stack.md` already has the 12-`@codemirror/*`
      Known-divergence entry; `README.md` already "nine-lens"; lens-7/8 write-back covered by review.md's
      "Done when: filed upstream". The one genuinely-missing lesson — **"never scope the unit lane with a
      `*.test.ts` glob" (skips subdirs, ~126 tests) — added to `testing.md`** (commit `417ce9e`, unpushed).

- [x] **Bumped tjs-lang 0.9.1 → 0.10.1** (2026-07-17, memory-storm fix). All three refs in lockstep
      (package.json dev+peer, `TJS_VERSION`). Required the inline-WASM guard update (0.10.x renamed
      the compiled export `__tjs_wasm_0` → collision-free `__tjs_wasm_<hash>_<n>`, tjs-lang#11 — guard
      now matches by pattern). #12 hand-roll deleted (`TjsAutocompleteConfig` → real `AutocompleteConfig`
      from `tjs-lang/editors/codemirror`, `import type` so zero bundle cost). All lanes green
      (unit + doc-tests + full Playwright). - [ ] **Still watch RSS over a real multi-day watch session** — the storm being gone is the whole
      point of the version; builds/lanes alone don't exercise a long-lived process. - [x] **#10 scope scanner deleted** — replaced ~272 lines (`extractTopLevelBindingNames` +
      `buildScopeCapture` + helpers) with `scopeCaptureEpilogue` from `tjs-lang/editors`. The
      "acorn bloat" worry was WRONG: that entry is a self-contained ~5KB file (no acorn), so the
      static import is negligible (hydrate 121.9→121.8KB gzip). Verified via `scope-autocomplete.test.ts`. - [ ] **#16 `tjsEditorExternal` — leave as belt-and-suspenders.** 0.10.x declares the
      `@codemirror/*` optional peerDeps, so the hard-fail it guarded is gone, but keep the probe
      until an isolated-tree build is actually verified without it.

- [ ] **RFC: language-plugin registry for live-example (tosijs-ui#12, from the tjs-lang side).**
      Invert the hardcoded `js|ts|tjs` dialect switch in `code-transform.ts` into a plugin
      contract (`transform`+diagnostics, optional `run`, optional output `panels`) so tjs-lang can
      register its AJS playground without tosijs-ui depending on `tjs-lang/vm`. The abstraction is
      only real if js/ts/tjs re-express as built-in plugins. A design task — coordinate with the
      language-plugins direction in doc-system-roadmap.md. Consumes tjs-lang#20 (TFS import
      resolver) + #18 (worker-ready WASM).

- [ ] **Remote dev-server access — one-command tunnel spike (queued after M10; the "dynamic DNS"
      ask).** Where we landed: a reverse **tunnel (`cloudflared`)** beats port-forward + dynamic
      DNS — no router/firewall changes, works behind CGNAT, HTTPS + a stable hostname for free, and
      nothing inbound is exposed. Spike a one-command `cloudflared tunnel` in front of the dev
      server with auth (Cloudflare Access, or Basic-Auth at the edge). If it's clean, productize as
      a `devServer` `remote: { tunnel, auth }` option so any tosijs-ui doc-system project gets
      "share what I'm working on" for free. **Never expose the dev server directly** (it shells out
      to `bun build`, reads the process table, binds ports — see the machine-health guards).

### From the 1.7 nine-lens review (`RELEASE-REVIEW-1.7-pass3.md`)

- [x] **M8 — gate the inline doc tests (incl. the inline-WASM guard) in CI.** ✅ DONE via
      **`tests/doc-tests.pw.ts`**: it navigates to `/`, awaits `window.__docTestResults` (the
      doc-browser's background runner iframes every page-with-tests on localhost and resolves it
      with the totals), and asserts `failed === 0`. Runs in the existing e2e job
      (`playwright test --project=chromium`) with **zero haltija** — so the WASM guard is behind
      the release gate for the first time. Also hardened the interactive haltija lane
      (`bun run test-browser`): the start-timeout path now calls `stopHaltija()` (was the naive
      `haltija.kill()` that leaked the Electron grandchild and poisoned the next run), and it
      adopts a _reachable_ haltija regardless of window count (no more racing a second instance
      next to a zero-window one).
      **Residuals (minor):** (a) WebKit is skipped in `doc-tests.pw.ts` — its iframe runner never
      posts per-page `tosi-tests-done`, so pages wait out the 30s per-page timeout and the corpus
      blows past budget; investigate the WebKit postMessage/iframe path. (b) `bun run test-browser`
      still **reuses/navigates a running haltija** (hijacks whatever window is open, another
      project's session included) — the clean fix is a dedicated instance via
      `HALTIJA_REGISTRY_DIR`/`--name` so it never touches the user's session. `doc-tests.pw.ts`
      already sidesteps both by using an isolated Playwright browser.

- [~] **M10 — the IIFE tripled: 121KB → 388KB gzip, ~100% CodeMirror.** HALF 1 DONE.
  The doc-site build now emits an **ESM `--splitting` hydration bundle** (`hydrate.js` + hashed
  chunks) that the served pages load as `<script type="module">`; `dist/iife.js` (classic) is
  kept for the CDN `<script>` path. Result: the always-loaded entry is **122.7kb gzip** (was
  388kb), and CodeMirror rides a lazy chunk. The tjs CM extension stays bundled and splitting
  preserves the shared single `@codemirror/state` (it and `code-editor-cm` import the same
  shared chunk). Verified: 41 Playwright green, pages hydrate via the module, editors work when
  loaded. **A page with no code examples now ships zero CodeMirror** — the headline case.
  **HALF 2 REMAINING — self-contained examples (bake the transpiled JS into the page).**
  Chosen approach, fully designed in [`self-contained-examples-plan.md`](self-contained-examples-plan.md).
  Supersedes the earlier "defer editor construction" idea: baking removes BOTH CodeMirror AND the
  tjs transpiler from first paint (deferring only editors still loads tjs to run a `tjs` preview),
  and makes a saved example runnable with zero runtime deps. The bake artifact is exactly what
  `check-examples` already computes per block; embed it as a hidden non-executing
  `<script type="application/tosi-transpiled">` co-located with the `<pre>`, keyed by source text.
  Four committable slices (build-side inert → runtime consume → defer editors → save). **Slices 1
  and 2 DONE:** tjs examples bake into hidden scripts and RUN from them on the reader path, and
  `loadTransform('js')` is now identity — so a reader page runs all its js+tjs examples with the
  tjs transpiler never requested on first paint (verified by a reader-path Playwright test + the
  doc-tests lane). **Slice 3 DONE too:** the `<tosi-code>` panels build lazily on first
  showCode (via `ensureEditors()`, not `content()`), so a reader page loads NEITHER the transpiler
  NOR CodeMirror on first paint — the M10 goal. Verified by a chunk-not-loaded-until-showCode
  Playwright test + the full 17-spec lane. **Slices 2b + 4 DONE:** 2b groups bakes per doc and
  attaches them to each Doc in `docs.json` (SPA-nav runs baked tjs examples too; only the 1 doc
  with tjs examples carries bakes, the other 56 add zero bytes). Slice 4 makes `refresh()` run a
  bake only while it matches the current source (an edit drops the stale bake and transpiles),
  and persists the transpiled code with a saved local edit so a restore runs transpiler-free.
  **M10 half 2 is COMPLETE.** **Do NOT gate the editor
  on "does this corpus have code examples"** — the doc system is an _authoring_ system; prose/book
  sites need the editor most.

- **Doc-system: pre-render the chrome, hydrate in place — and drop the opacity gate.**
  Generated pages currently hide the whole body (`body{opacity:0}`, 4s safety-net timeout)
  until the bundle hydrates, because hydration injects the entire chrome (an undefined custom
  element is `display:inline`, so the un-upgraded page stacks as bare text) and collapses each
  example's `js`/`test`/`css` blocks into one live-example. That reflow is why the gate exists.

  **The markup is already all there** — nav tree, header, content, code blocks, `<tosi-doc-system>`
  host; a component page is 9.5KB of HTML. What's missing is CSS for the _un-upgraded_ state.
  Fix: a **size-gated layout** that tucks the unhydrated body into a scrolling rectangle
  positioned as though the header and (on wide viewports) the sidebar were already there —
  `tosi-doc-system:not(:defined)` + its light-DOM children, in the burned static stylesheet.
  Hide the non-`js` blocks and reserve the preview's space so live-example replacement is
  in-place. Then hydration is purely additive, nothing moves, and the gate can go.

  Why it matters (measured on the built site, gzipped, CPU-throttled — 6x ≈ mid Android,
  12x ≈ cheap phone / Pi4). "Visible" = the gate lifting, i.e. blank-screen duration:

  | device                     | 1.7 (387KB gz)                    | editor-free (121KB gz) |
  | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | laptop, fast wifi          | 685ms                             | 505ms                  |
  | mid Android, 4G            | 1976ms                            | 1316ms                 |
  | cheap phone / Pi4, slow 4G | 4532ms                            | 3667ms                 |
  | cheap phone / Pi4, 3G      | 4837ms — _hits the 4s safety net_ | 4831ms — _ditto_       |

  Note the 3G row: hydration loses to the safety net, so the reader gets 4s of blank **and**
  the un-hydrated flash anyway. The gate only pays off while hydration is fast. With the chrome
  pre-rendered, content is readable at FCP (~300–500ms) on every device, and the bundle gates
  _editing_ rather than _reading_.

  Do NOT just delete the gate: that trades a clean blank→hydrated (2 states) for
  blank→dead-page→hydrated (3 states) for everyone, i.e. a flash of content that then shifts.

- **Split the editor out of the hydration bundle** (pairs with the above). The editor stack is
  **66% of the bundle**: `@codemirror/*` (1061KB src), `@lezer/*` (384KB), `acorn` (296KB — it
  arrives via the tjs _autocomplete_ extension, not the transpiler), + the tjs CM extension. The
  transpiler is already external (`tjs-lang/browser`, fetched at runtime), so **live examples
  would still run** — only the code _panels_ need CodeMirror. The lazy boundary
  (`import('./code-editor-cm')`) already works under ESM; only `--format=iife` can't split.
  Two halves: (1) emit the hydration bundle as ESM + `--splitting` + `<script type="module">`,
  keeping the IIFE for the CDN path (`bundle-guard`'s classic-script check must go module-aware);
  (2) defer editor _construction_ until a code panel is first shown — otherwise live-example
  eagerly builds 4–5 hidden editors per example and pulls the chunk anyway.

- **Diff view: allow reverting changes from it.** `<tosi-code>`'s `showDiff(on)` overlay
  (`src/code-editor.ts` → `tosi-diff`) is read-only — you can see what changed against the
  baseline but not act on it. Let the reader revert from the diff: per-hunk revert at minimum,
  and revert-all. This is the review step of the doc-system's edit-and-save-to-source flow, so
  "I see the change and I don't want it" currently means retyping it by hand.
- **JSON Schema-driven form editor** - Integrate schema-based form generation
- **Doc-system: expose customization of the app/settings menu** — The `<tosi-doc-system>` settings button (the moreVertical/gear menu, `settingsButton()` in `src/doc-system/doc-system.ts`, `title="settings"`) builds its `menuItems` array inline (Print as PDF, Download ePub, Language, Color Theme, …). There's currently no public API for a doc-site consumer to add, remove, reorder, or override these items. Add a way to customize it — e.g. a `SiteConfig` hook or a `menuItems` prop/callback that receives the default items and returns the desired set — and surface/document it in `doc-site-system.md`.

## Book / prose adoption (from `falling-forward`, 1.6.15)

The doc-system assumes a **code library with a `src/` tree**; a book has no code,
uses different Markdown, and needs a _curated book artifact_, not just a site.
Full write-up in the adopter's `TOSIJS-UI-FEEDBACK.md`.

**Done (quick wins):**

- ✅ #4 Auto-serve `/iife.js` when `bundleEntry` is omitted (copy tosijs-ui's own
  iife into the output, version-matched) — pure-docs sites hydrate out of the box.
- ✅ #7 Skip `_`-prefixed scaffolding files (`_template.md`, `_drafting-log.md`).
- ✅ #12 Empty metadata `title` falls back to the H1 (was blanking nav entries).
- ✅ #6 Warn when no ePub cover is generated (@resvg/resvg-js missing); title-only
  cover already works when it's present.

**Batch A done (rendering pipeline, syntax-activated → safe default-on):**

- ✅ #2 **YAML frontmatter** — `parseFrontmatter` in docs.ts parses & strips a
  leading `---…---` block, maps `title`/`order`/`author`/`date`/`draft`→hidden;
  frontmatter wins over JSON-comment metadata; empty title falls back to H1; a
  bare `---` rule is left alone.
- ✅ #5 **Wikilinks** `[[slug]]` / `[[slug|label]]` → `/slug/` (marked inline
  extension; not matched inside code spans). _First cut resolves by slugifying the
  target; a real corpus-basename match + unknown-target handling is a follow-up._
- ✅ #1 **Footnotes — ePub/web first cut**: `[^id]` refs (numbered by appearance)
  - `[^id]: def` collected into an endnotes `<section>` with backrefs (marked
    extensions). _Still TODO: page-anchored footnotes w/ cross-refs — a
    **print-to-PDF** feature (browser Print path, not a batch job): build the full
    DOM, compute pagination, then settle page numbers + footnote positioning by
    pushing content across page boundaries (roadmap "measured rectangles"). Also:
    multi-line/paragraph footnote definitions._

**Batch B done (curation, overlay-on-defaults):**

- ✅ #3 **First-class "book" corpus** — `book: BookManifest` in site config
  (`src/doc-system/book-manifest.ts`, pure + unit-tested). Curates/reorders the
  book artifact WITHOUT touching site nav (one source, two outputs). Zero-config
  = whole visible corpus (unchanged). `include`/`exclude` globs select docs;
  `order: [...]` names the lead sequence (front/back matter are just docs you
  name); `sort: 'filename'` gives a folder of chapters natural order with no
  metadata. Identity (title/author/cover) still comes from `epub`. It never adds
  a new ordering mechanism — it overlays each doc's `order` so the shared
  buildNavTree/flatten sequences the book (pins/parents still apply). Applied in
  `buildEpub`; **print path (buildBookHtml, client Print button) still uses the
  whole corpus** — wire the manifest there when print/PDF pagination lands.
  _Deferred: a content-author YAML manifest file (`_book.md`) as an alt to the
  typed config — per-doc frontmatter already covers per-doc metadata._

**Queued — P1:**

- #14a **Smart typography** (curly quotes / en-em dashes / ellipsis) — deferred
  from Batch A: unlike wikilinks/footnotes it rewrites ALL prose, so it must be
  **opt-in** via config (pairs with #9's `kind: 'book'` preset; needs config
  threaded to `renderDocMarkdown`).

**Queued — P2:**

- #8 Order by filename/path within a section (natural sort), `order` as override.
- #9 A `kind: 'book' | 'library'` preset with sane content-project defaults
  (no `src/`/`demo/` assumptions).
- #10 Folder structure implies nav sections (`chapters/book-1/*` → "Book 1").

**Queued — P3:**

- #11 Friendlier metadata entry (the planned metadata UI, or #2's YAML).
- #13 Optional built-in epubcheck (or a documented validation pass).
- #14 Smart typography (curly quotes, en/em dashes, ellipsis) opt-in; word-count
  / reading-time per doc + total.

## Example captures (live-example → static images)

Design landed; not built. See **"Example captures"** in
[doc-system-roadmap.md](doc-system-roadmap.md). Capture is _exhaust from normal
dev_: embedded **private haltija** (per-app socket, beta 10) holds a single
`getDisplayMedia` stream and `grabFrame()`s on demand (crop to the example rect),
so testing/posing an example self-captures; haltija puppeting fills gaps. Manual
captures are sticky; organic ones refresh only when the example's **code hash**
changes. One asset, three consumers: **ePub images**, **no-JS / pre-hydration
placeholder**, optional ePub cover hero. Builds on `ExampleKey` + the dev-write
endpoint (Foundations B/C). Depends on **#5 (haltija-in-dev widget)** landing the
private-mode socket first.

**Book ↔ live-site fidelity ladder** (phase-2, greenlit) — one example source, three
tiers: (1) static captured image + code (every reader); (2) each book example
**deep-links to its anchored spot on the live site** (ePub/PDF link + **QR for
print**), version-pinned `/v{version}/{slug}/#{id}`, stable `id=` fences not
ordinals; (3) **inline interactive** in Apple Books / Readium via scripted EPUB3
(`properties="scripted"`, pre-transpiled + inlined, image fallback — NOT the dead
iBooks Author format). Needs per-example **anchors + scroll-to/highlight on the
live site** (independently useful). See roadmap "From book to live."

## Live examples

- **Fully-isolated example option (future, not default).** Live examples run inline
  on the shared page by default — deliberate: it shows off tosi's isolation and lets
  you drive demos through the global singleton. The `iframe` attribute isolates
  DOM/CSS but NOT tosijs state (the `tosijs`/`tosijs-ui` modules injected into the
  iframe are the host page's instances, so `tosi()` singletons stay shared). A
  _totally_ isolated mode — separate module realm so `tosi()` state and imported
  deps are sandboxed too — would follow tjs-lang's playground approach: a **service
  worker intercepting dependency imports**. Worth offering eventually as an opt-in;
  the shared-page default stays the right behavior for real examples. Documented +
  warned about in the `<tosi-example>` doc ("How examples run") and surfaced in
  llms.txt.

## Medium Priority

- **Vector similarity search for doc-browser** - Replace current search with vector-based approach
- **Focus management and focus-visible styling** - Improve keyboard navigation and focus indicators

## `dev.tosijs.net/<code>` short URL — host-side, not shipped (#132)

Two of #132's three asks landed in 1.14.0: the code is **8 letters, no digits**, and the
invite page already had a code box (from #75) so a bookmarked host plus eight letters is the
whole entry flow. The third needs infrastructure this repo does not own:

- **`dev.tosijs.net/<code>` → 302 to the tunnel.** Saves ~18 characters and, more to the
  point, every piece of punctuation: no scheme, no `?`, no `=`, no four-dots-and-a-hyphen
  host. It needs a service at the apex that maps a code to a subdomain, which means the
  preview box's Caddy config, and it needs the code→tunnel map to live somewhere both the
  redirector and the dev server can see. Today the map is per-process, in memory, and dies
  with the server (#114, deliberately) — so the redirector cannot consult it without either
  a shared store or a call back into the tunnel.
- Worth pairing with **#75** (PWA cookie jar) if it happens: the reporter notes a code field
  would let an installed PWA carry its own entry point rather than depending on a redirect
  that happens in Safari.

The reason this is worth more than the character count: **sessions die with the process
(#114), so the typing cost is paid on every restart, not once.** The reporter minted four
links in one session, three of them because of release-build restarts. Cheap re-entry is what
makes the #114 decision comfortable rather than a tax.

## Startup budget and output budget — two standing policies (2026-09-04)

Written down because both were violated silently and gradually, which is the only way this
kind of thing ever happens.

- **`bun start` should have a server listening in ~5 seconds.** A target, not a gate —
  the point is that a big number means something is _wrong_, not that the project got
  bigger. It was 1–2s and had become ~23s. Do not fail anything over a few hundred ms.
- **A build must not print more than ~20 lines.** Currently **37**, of which **18** are the
  bundler listing every chunk and sourcemap. Spam trains people — and agents — to stop
  reading, which is what lets a real failure through.
- **Nothing outside code quality and DX belongs in the blocking path.**

### Measured, 2026-09-04 — and the obvious suspect was innocent

```
  0.00s  $ bun bin/dev.ts --build-only
 20.13s  ⚠️  could not run `bun audit` … Skipping the dependency gate
 20.43s  [298.75ms] prebuild
 22.63s  iife bundle
 22.99s  generated 66 static pages
 23.33s  epub (66 chapters)
 23.34s  [2.89s] build     ← the build's own timer, vs 23.35s wall clock
```

- **The ePub is 0.34s.** It was the assumed cause and it is nearly free. Do not "fix" it.
- **The audit gate is 20.13s of the 23.** It hits `AUDIT_TIMEOUT_MS = 20_000`, gives up, and
  **fails open** — so the twenty seconds buys literally nothing on that run. `bun audit`
  standalone measured **79.5s** against the live registry.
- **The build's self-reported `[2.89s]` is off by 8x.** It times `buildSite` only. That
  mis-measurement is a large part of why this was never noticed: the number on the screen
  said everything was fine.

### Done so far (2026-09-04)

|                         | before   | after        |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| `bun start` → listening | ~23s     | **5.7s**     |
| `bun start` output      | 40 lines | **16 lines** |
| `bun run build` output  | 37 lines | **13 lines** |

- **Audit gate is non-blocking on `bun start`** (below). Still synchronous in `buildSite`,
  which is where release builds and `--test` pay it — the right trade there.
- **Bundler listings captured, not inherited.** 18 of the 37 lines were `bun build` naming
  every chunk and sourcemap. Replayed in full on failure, verified by breaking the entry:
  errors still print, exit is still 1, last-good is still restored.

**Still to do.** ~3.6s is fine — the ~5s figure is a target, not a gate. It exists to catch
the next 23s regression, not to be optimised against.

Where the remaining 3.6s actually goes, measured per phase:

| phase                                        | time      | share   |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| prebuild (version + doc extraction)          | 0.42s     | 12%     |
| **bundling — iife then hydrate, sequential** | **2.27s** | **64%** |
| static pre-render (66 pages)                 | 0.20s     | 6%      |
| ePub (66 chapters)                           | 0.33s     | 9%      |
| bind + listeners                             | 0.27s     | 8%      |

- **Static pre-render + ePub are 0.53s together**, not the bulk. They _are_ both
  post-dates-the-1–2s-era additions, which is why they feel like the cause — but the
  arithmetic says otherwise today.
- **The reason to defer them anyway is SCALING, not today's half-second.** Both are O(corpus):
  0.20s and 0.33s at 66 docs. A book-sized corpus (the prose/novel adoption this system is
  explicitly for) pays that per `bun start`, and neither is needed to serve the page you are
  looking at. The SPA fallback already answers un-pre-rendered routes — that is exactly what
  #116 established — so binding first and pre-rendering behind it degrades gracefully rather
  than 404ing.
- **The dominant cost is bundling, and the two bundles are independent.** iife → `BUNDLE_DIR`,
  hydrate → a temp dir; the checks between them only read the iife output. Starting both
  children and awaiting the second after the iife post-processing would overlap ~1.1s. Not
  done: it restructures a delicate path, doubles peak bundler memory in a repo with a
  documented history of exactly that, and buys ~1s against a budget already met. Worth
  revisiting only if bundling grows.
- **Live-example / doc-test failures still escape notice** — the item below. Nothing has
  been done there yet, and it is the part that actually costs correctness rather than
  patience.
- The build's self-reported timer still measures only `buildSite`, so it will keep
  understating wall clock. Either widen it or drop it.

### The audit gate specifically

`CLAUDE.md` claims "the audit is sub-second, and a gate you wait for can't be raced". The
first half is false — it is 79.5s when the registry is slow — so the second half is buying a
20s stall on every `bun start` and every build.

**Make it non-blocking but hard to miss.** Decided direction:

- Never block `bun start`. Bind the port first; run the audit after, and report when it
  lands.
- Report loudly enough that a finding cannot scroll past — this is the one thing that must
  not get quieter as part of the spam cleanup.
- Keep it blocking for **release** builds, where waiting is the correct trade.
- We are too belt-and-suspenders here generally, especially for a library whose runtime
  dependency set is nearly empty (the 12 CodeMirror packages are the whole of it, and #58
  already records that cost as accepted).

### Live-example / test failures must not escape notice

Related and the reason the spam budget matters: **agents do not notice red text.** A failing
doc test currently prints in colour among 37 lines and is simply missed by the main consumer
of this output. Failure needs to be structural — a non-zero exit, a final summary block, or a
machine-readable artifact — not a colour.

## tjs-lang: bump again when 0.13.12 lands (#135)

We are on **0.13.11** (was a deprecated 0.13.4). **0.13.12 is not published yet** and carries
the fix that matters for a doc site: a `test '…' { }` written inside a template literal or a
double-quoted string was mistaken for a real test block on ≤0.13.11 — the body executed at
transpile time **in the host page**, outside the iframe sandbox, and the text was deleted from
the output. Both silent.

It does not bite us today (no example of ours quotes a test block) but it would the moment we
documented tjs the way tjs-lang does — it cost them 52 of 99 failures in their own gate.

Two pins to move, and a test now enforces they agree: `TJS_VERSION` in
`src/live-example/code-transform.ts` and the exact `tjs-lang` devDependency.

## Playwright: a standalone doc-tests run can be a FALSE GREEN (2026-09-05)

`bunx playwright test tests/doc-tests.pw.ts --project=chromium` reported **62 passed** against
a build containing a broken example (an executable ```ts fence calling `process.on`), and the
**same spec failed inside the full-suite run** with the real error. Fixed the example; did not
diagnose the discrepancy.

Until it is understood, **the full suite is the gate** — a green standalone doc-tests run is
not evidence. Related to, but distinct from, the Firefox flake noted further down: that one is
load-dependent flakiness, this one silently passed something that was genuinely broken.

## RFC (practices): site release branch + version release branches — open for discussion

[tosijs-coding-practices#10](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-coding-practices/issues/10).
**Discussion only — do not implement.** Two separable practices:

- **Site release branch** — generated output moves off the source branch. Reads as the clear
  win: `main` here tracks 969 generated files — **but only 106 of those are site output**;
  863 are `dist/`, the published package, which a site branch cannot address (correction from
  tjs-lang on the RFC, who separated "site output" from "derived artifacts that are also
  inputs"). Even at 106 it is the direct cause of the
  `merge=ours` driver, #122's restamping, and the standing "don't commit `docs/` from a
  feature push" hazard. Adoptable at any maturity because it changes where build output lands,
  not how anyone works. Cost to name: this repo serves Pages from `docs/` on `main`, so
  migration means repointing Pages.
- **Version release branches** — needs argument, and presupposes a release process. Suggested
  shape is "branch late, receive only, delete after tag", not one per minor.

If a `release/1.14` branch happens here it is a **trial**, reported as such, not an adopted
practice — and the RFC notes a project *on the cusp* of deliberate versioning may be the more
informative place to trial it than one that already has the discipline.

## 1.14.0 is GATED on tosijs — the minor SHIPPED, but adoption is blocked (updated 2026-09-04)

**tosijs 1.10.0 is out and adopted on the `tosijs-1.10-adoption` branch — 418 type errors → 0,
1300 tests green — but it CANNOT MERGE.** `tsc --declaration` fails TS2742 on all 34 migrated
files, so no `.d.ts` is emitted for any component. Filed as
[tosijs#38](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs/issues/38); see `UPSTREAM.md`.

When the fix lands: `git checkout tosijs-1.10-adoption`, bump tosijs, re-run
`bunx tsc --declaration` to confirm, merge, raise the peer floor to `^1.10.x` **recording the
reason**, and run all four lanes.

Already landed on `main` from the attempt: the `filter-builder` defect the migration exposed
(`getSelectText` returned `''` on every call). It predates the adoption and did not wait on it.

## Original note: 1.14.0 is GATED on the next tosijs minor — do not publish before it

**Decision (2026-09-04): hold 1.14.0 until tosijs ships its next minor, then adopt it and
release together.** That release is a **breaking minor**: a large DX win in exchange for a
small change to how components are declared. Every component in `src/` declares itself the
current way, so adoption is a mechanical sweep across all of them plus the doc corpus'
examples — which is exactly the kind of change that should ride one release, not two.

**What the DX win is: element creators will know their component's attributes.** So
`tosiWidget({ … })` becomes type-checked against that component's `initAttributes` instead of
accepting anything. Consequences to plan for:

- The sweep is **type-level, not behavioural** — expect the compiler, not the test suite, to
  find the work. Budget for a pass where nothing runs differently and a lot of signatures move.
- **Expect it to surface real defects**, the way typechecking the tests did in this same
  cycle (#73 found `SVGIconMap` claiming `SVGElement` for composites that are spans). An
  attribute typo in a creator call is exactly the class of bug that has been invisible until
  now, and there are ~40 components' worth of call sites plus every doc example.
- The `bun run typecheck` gate added for #73 now covers library, `bin/` and tests, so the
  sweep gets checked everywhere in one command. Landing that gate BEFORE this adoption was
  luckier than planned.
- Doc examples are executed, not just compiled (`checkExamples` + the inline `test` tier), so
  a creator-call change has to be swept through the corpus too, not only `src/`.

**Also landing in 1.14.0: `<tosi-3d>` is deprecated in favour of `tosijs-3d`** (done —
doc page, `@deprecated` tags, and a once-per-page console notice on first use). Nothing is
removed; the reason is duplicated effort, not a defect. `tosijs-3d` is the better library and
grew out of this component, so migration is mostly a rename. Removal is a future major, and
worth pairing with whatever else that major carries — see below for what a `tosijs-3d`-shaped
successor implies for `src/babylon-3d.ts` and its `via-tag.ts` `scriptTag` dependency, which
has a known latent onload-after-append race that is not worth fixing in deprecated code.

What this means for the version:

- **1.14.0 is confirmed as a minor**, and its headline is the tosijs adoption. The icons
  type correction (composites are spans, not `SVGElement`) was already forcing a minor on
  its own; it now rides along rather than justifying the bump by itself.
- The peer floor moves to the new tosijs. Record the REASON here when it lands, per the
  standing rule that the floor encodes specific upstream fixes and not a date.
- The CHANGELOG's `## 1.14.0 (unreleased)` section is already open. Add the adoption section
  at its top when the sweep happens — the entries below it (icons, #73, #85, #122, #123)
  are done and need no rework.

Do not cut a 1.13.1 from the work already on `main` to "get it out sooner": the icons change
breaks type-level code, and a patch that breaks you is the one thing the version contract
promises never happens.

Current state: tosijs `latest` is **1.9.2** (a patch — our `^1.9.1` floor already admits it;
we have 1.9.1 installed). The `beta` and `rc` dist-tags are stale (1.7.0-beta.2, 1.8.0-rc.3),
so they are not previews of this work.

## From the 1.13.0 post-publish verification (2026-09-03)

Found by installing the **published** tarball from the registry and running a bin by hand —
not by any lane, because no lane runs a shipped bin's argument handling (see `CLAUDE.md`,
`SAFE_TO_RUN`).

- [x] **`tosijs-release-notes` does not recognise `--help`.** DONE — fixed with #85, which
      replaced all four bins' hand-rolled `flag()`/`has()` pairs with one `parseArgv`. Every
      bin now answers `--help` (exit 0) and refuses an unknown flag (exit 1), verified from a
      directory with no project. The parse happens **before** the site config is read, which
      is what makes `--help` work outside a project at all.
- [ ] **No lane executes a shipped bin's CLI surface.** `bin/smoke-consumer.ts` checks
      shebangs only, for a good reason (running `tosijs-deploy` would write to `/etc` on the
      real preview box). Still worth a `--help`-only execution pass: `--help` now provably
      exits 0 before any config read or network contact in all four bins, so running just
      that flag is safe, and it is the one assertion that would have caught the above.
      `bin/argv.test.ts` covers the parser directly, but not the bins' own wiring of it.

## From the 1.13.0 pre-release review (`reviews/1.13.0-pre-release.md`)

Blockers and majors were fixed in the remediation pass. These are the deferred remainder —
**none may be dropped**; the review file is the record of what was found and not fixed.

- [ ] **M1 (partial)** `/__build` still answers only when the build finishes, so the budget is
      capped by the server's 120s idle timeout rather than the build's real length. The client
      now matches that number instead of promising ten minutes it cannot keep, and reports "did
      not answer in time — the build may still be running". The real fix is a keepalive stream
      or `202` + poll, which resets the idle clock and gives the CLI progress.
- [ ] **M3 (partial)** Both tautological unit tests are replaced with ones that mount the real
      component / import the shipped predicate, and mutation-tested. Still missing the **wire
      test**: boot a dev server, POST `/__build`, assert the JSON shape and that a
      non-loopback/tunnel/cross-site request is refused. `__build` currently appears in no
      browser test.
- [ ] **F2** Type the `doc-browser → doc-system` `sourceMenuItems` seam — a rename compiles
      clean and silently drops the Source submenu. Give the app-menu button a stable `part`
      hook and select on it in `tests/doc-system.pw.ts` instead of the `top < 60` geometry
      heuristic, which can drive the _nested_ browser.
- [ ] **F3** Standalone `createDocBrowser` consumers and nested `<tosi-doc-system>` lose
      view/edit-source in 1.13.0 with no replacement — say so in the notes.
- [ ] **F4** Move the test-lane `8798` default into the shared `resolveDevPort`; it was
      extracted for #39 so two resolvers could not drift, and the inline default reintroduces
      one. Harmless today only because the tunnel is skipped in `testMode`.
- [ ] **F6** `makeIcon` reparses its spec on every call; the pocket-bar handle went from a
      138-byte glyph to a 2857-byte 17-node owl on every live example. Cache the parsed
      `<template>` per spec and `cloneNode(true)` — helps the whole icon system.
- [ ] **F7** The `versionAnchoredDate` doc block sits two definitions from what it documents.
- [ ] **F8** `epub.ts` runs `find . -exec touch -t … {} +` with no assertion that `buildDir` is
      the staging dir. Safe today (derived, freshly created); add the precondition before a
      recursive mtime rewrite.
- [ ] **F9** The owl handle is hardcoded on every live example of every adopter's site. The new
      `--tosi-pocket-handle-*` vars make the chip brandable but not the glyph — add a var, or
      decide it is deliberate and say so.
- [ ] **F10** Add a delegation opt-out (`opts.delegate: false` / env) for CI and release scripts
      that need an in-process build with their own config.
- [ ] **F1 (recorded, not fixable now)** `<tosi-tabs>` logs an `on<Event>`-collision warning
      because of our deprecated `onCloseTab` alias. Removing it is breaking → next major. The
      1.13.0 notes now say so instead of claiming a clean console.
- [x] **F5 — REFUTED.** `--tosi-pocket-handle-size` was said to overshoot by 2×padding on a
      content-box button. Measured: with `size: 32px` the handle computes to exactly **32×32**,
      so `border-box` is already in effect. No change needed.

## Localization

- Adding automatic localization where appropriate:

  - `<tosi-password-strength>`
  - `<tosi-tag-list>`
  - `<tosi-filter>`

- **`<tosi-example>` / `<tosi-code>` / `<tosi-diff>` are not localizable AT ALL** — parked
  deliberately (2026-08-31): real, but below other work. Audited at 1.12.6, so nobody has to
  re-derive it:

  | component        | `localized` attr | imports `localize` | visible strings                                               |
  | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `<tosi-example>` | no               | no                 | **18** (7 button `title`s, 11 menu captions) + 1 notification |
  | `<tosi-code>`    | no               | no                 | none of its own — only the diff labels it forwards            |
  | `<tosi-diff>`    | no               | no                 | 2 (`originalLabel`/`modifiedLabel`)                           |

  **The cheapest win is already sitting there**: live-example's overflow menu goes through
  `popMenu`, which localizes every caption and propagates into submenus — `<tosi-table>` passes
  `localized: this.localized` to it — but `src/live-example/component.ts:1499` never passes the
  flag. So "Refresh", "View changes", "Revert to original", "Save to source" are English-only
  inside a component that could translate them for free. That is one option, not eleven strings.

  The rest: a `localized` attribute on `<tosi-example>` wrapping its 18 literals, and one on
  `<tosi-diff>` running the two labels through `localize()` the way `captionSpan` does. The
  labels are host-supplied props, so a host CAN pass pre-localized strings today — that is
  documented, and is why this is a gap rather than a defect.

  **Generate the required-strings list, do not hand-write it.** `<tosi-table>` documents its
  set ("Sort / Show / Hide / Column / …") by hand and that list is exactly the kind of thing
  that drifts from the source. Whatever ships here should extract the keys from the components.

  Note `Source`/`Yours` (the selective-revert labels added in 1.12.6) are two more English
  literals on this pile — not a regression, since nothing in this subtree was ever localizable.

- **`<tosi-table>`'s column header menu: the CONCATENATION half is still open.** The
  ambiguity half is fixed — the keys now carry `#annotation` disambiguators
  (`Right#direction`, `Column#table`, `Sort#order`, …) and `demo/src/localized-strings.ts`
  has matching rows. That part shipped in a patch because annotating a key falls back to the
  bare row, so it cannot orphan an adopter's table.

  What remains is the word-order defect at `src/data-table.ts:2542, 2551, 2567, 2578`:
  `${localize('Sort#order')} ${localize('Ascending#sort-order')}`, and the same for
  hide/show + column. Two fragments, joined in English order, which no translation can
  rearrange. It should become one key — `localize('Sort ascending')` — which is mostly a
  DELETION, because `popMenu({localized})` already localizes every caption and propagates
  `localized` into submenus, so these are being localized twice today.

  **Not done, because that one moves the keys.** An adopter's table has `Sort` and
  `Ascending` rows; afterwards neither matches and the menu reverts to English. The
  annotation fallback does not help here — it falls back on the annotation, not on
  fragments. So it needs a release note naming the new keys, or a fragment fallback, and it
  belongs in a minor.

  Worth knowing for the translations themselves: a native-speaker pass is still owed. The
  corrections made were the ones where the SENSE was wrong; several entries are merely less
  idiomatic than the local UI term (ja `選別` for sort, es `Clasificar`, zh `展示` for show)
  and were deliberately left alone rather than asserting more than could be verified.

## Playwright: a Firefox flake under full-suite load (2026-09-01)

`tests/table-pinned-repeat.pw.ts:56` ("a repeated cell in a pinned column stays opaque and
stays hit-testable") failed once on **firefox** in a full-suite run, and passed both in
isolation and on an immediate full re-run. So: load-dependent, Firefox-only, not a regression
from the change under test.

Recorded rather than dropped, per the practice that a red test is never waved through as
"unrelated". It is not scheduled as urgent because it has been seen once — but if it recurs,
start from the worker-contention work below (1.12.1), which addressed the same class, and
check whether the pinned-cell opacity assertion is racing a paint rather than a state.

## DONE (1.12.1): the Playwright lane's worker contention

- [x] Both halves of the `hydration.pw.ts` / `docs.json` flake are now addressed. The client
      half shipped in 1.11.0 (`fetchCorpus` retries 429/5xx/network with full-jitter backoff).
      The server half is here: local workers are pinned to **6** instead of Playwright's
      default ~half-the-cores (9 on this box).

      Measured rather than guessed — 9 workers ran the suite in 82s, 6 in 81s, so the lane is
      not CPU-bound at 9 and a third of the concurrent load on the single dev server is free.
      4 workers costs 106s (+30%) and buys nothing further. 6/6 full runs clean afterwards
      against a prior rate near 1 in 5.

      Suggestive, not proof — 6 runs cannot demonstrate a 1-in-5 rate is gone. If it recurs,
      re-measure rather than dropping workers further on instinct.

## DONE (1.12.1): `<tosi-schema-form>` perf guards, both gaps closed

- [x] **The structural-edit path is guarded** (`syncValues`, run on add/remove-item rather than
      on keystrokes). A root-scoped per-field scan there passed the keystroke test; the new
      sibling takes it from 1 lookup per add to 41 -> 161 as fields grow.

- [x] **Wall-clock is back, and now it holds.** It had been removed for flaking at 9 workers
      (firefox: 2.67x isolated vs 9.25x loaded for the same 4x-fields measurement — load and
      regression indistinguishable). At 6 workers the distributions overlap — isolated 3.20-4.57
      across all three engines, under full load 2.64-4.14 — so the threshold of 8 sits 1.75x
      above the worst measurement and 2x below quadratic's 16.

      The three guards are complementary and the mutations prove it rather than assert it: an
      O(N) scan per field using no selector at all fails the timing guard at 9.63x while both
      count guards pass, and re-finding the error slot per field fails the count guard while
      timing stays linear at ~4x.

      Two traps worth not re-learning. Build with output VISIBLE when mutation testing — a
      first attempt "passed" because the rebuild was silenced with `>/dev/null 2>&1` and the
      lane tested a stale bundle. And never grep `dist/iife.js` to check a mutation landed:
      minification renames locals, so the string is absent whether or not the code is.

## `layout: full-screen` — needs a collapsed state on `<tosi-side-nav>`

- [ ] `layout: 'full-width'` shipped (#105); `'full-screen'` did not, and is **rejected with a
      message** rather than half-honoured.

      Why it does not work as CSS: after hydration the nav is a `div.doc-nav` inside
      `<tosi-side-nav>` carrying an INLINE `display: flex`, and side-nav sets `--nav-width` as
      an inline property too. A stylesheet cannot override either without `!important`.
      Hiding `<tosi-side-nav>` itself is not the answer — it wraps the content as well as the
      nav, so that hides the page.

      The fix belongs in the component: a collapsed/hidden state on `<tosi-side-nav>` that
      `full-screen` can set, which is what the original request anticipated ("would also entail
      changing side-nav's behavior slightly"). Doing it as `!important` from the doc-system
      would work and would be the wrong layer.

## Dev-server caching: revalidate instead of forbidding storage (parked on a branch)

- [ ] **Parked at `dev-cache-revalidate` (`56dcb03a`) — not merged.** 1.12.3 ships the blunt
      version: `Cache-Control: no-store` on everything the dev server serves. That is correct —
      nothing can be used stale, which is what the Safari incident needed — but it forbids
      _storing_, so a browser re-downloads the whole bundle on every page load, forever.

      The parked branch is the better shape: `no-cache` (keep it, but revalidate before every
      use) plus an ETag of `mtime-size-encoding`, with `If-None-Match` answered by a 304 and no
      body. Encoding is in the tag because the brotli and gzip bodies differ and honouring one
      against the other's validator hands the client bytes it cannot decode. HTML keeps
      `no-store` **when it is injected per request** — the dev-channel loader, the build-status
      widget and session-dependent content mean a validator derived from disk would be a lie;
      when nothing is injected it takes the ordinary asset path, which is why the test asserts
      "unusable without revalidation" rather than one header spelling.

      Already verified on the branch: assets revalidate to 304, and touching a file yields a new
      tag and fresh bytes. Tests are written (`tests/dev-no-cache.pw.ts`, 12 passing).

      **Why it is not merged.** I justified it with a measurement I cannot support: the lane at
      1.3m before `no-store` and 1.9-2.7m after, blamed on the change — while an orphaned
      haltija Electron from another project sat at 5.7GB and ~150% CPU with the machine at load
      **212** (see haltija#39). That comparison is confounded. The design stands on its own
      terms; it should land behind a clean measurement rather than behind a number that was
      wrong.

      **Baseline taken (quiet machine, load ~5, 18GB free): 149s / 161s / 183s on `main`.**
      Which kills the premise a second time — the "1.3m before" figure I compared against was a
      run of a SMALLER suite (233 tests; it is 239 now, after the Back and cache tests were
      added). So the original claim was confounded by machine load AND by suite growth. Two
      independent reasons the number meant nothing, neither of which I checked before asserting
      it.

      **To finish:** time the branch three times on an equally quiet machine, and account for the
      fact that the branch's own cache tests differ in count from main's. Merge if revalidation is not slower — and if the honest
      answer is that `no-store` never cost anything measurable, say so and merge it anyway for
      being the accurate header, or drop it and keep the simpler code. Either is fine; guessing
      is not.

## Responsive testing: widths are covered, touch is not

- [x] **The inline doc tier now runs at two widths.** The runner's test iframe was hardcoded
      800x600, so every inline test had only ever run wide — which is why 1.12.3's narrow-layout
      regression was invisible to it and a reader found it instead. The size is now overridable
      via `globalThis.__tosiTestViewport`, and `tests/doc-tests.pw.ts` runs the whole tier a
      second time at 390x844. Verified the override actually reaches the runner: 390px frame
      (386 inner) with it, 800px (796) without.

- [ ] **Touch/pointer emulation is NOT possible from inside a page**, and should not be faked.
      Measured: an iframe inherits the host's input characteristics, so `(pointer: coarse)` is
      false and `maxTouchPoints` is 0 however small the frame is. `navigator.maxTouchPoints` can
      be redefined with `Object.defineProperty`, and doing that would be worse than skipping it —
      the property would lie while `matchMedia` told the truth, so a test could pass on a page
      behaving as desktop.

      Where it belongs: a Playwright **context**, which can set `hasTouch`, `isMobile` and a full
      device profile (`devices['iPhone 13']`). That is a separate spec against real components —
      menus, tooltips, drag handles, `<tosi-sidenav>` — not something the doc tier can host.
      Worth doing: everything touch-shaped in this library is currently tested only with a mouse.

## Hydration flash: the sidenav's transition suppression is no longer a race

- [x] `<tosi-sidenav>` suppressed its transition for a fixed `setTimeout(…, 250)` while the first
      `handleResize` moved it off its compact defaults. That is a race, not a rule: it assumes
      the first successful layout pass lands within 250ms of the element upgrading. Measured
      here it lands ~70ms after (chromium 236->297, webkit 213->291, firefox 229->304), leaving
      ~175ms spare — which is why it does not reproduce locally. `handleResize` returns early
      while `offsetParent` is null, so on a bigger corpus or a slower device the first pass can
      be deferred past the window and the sidebar visibly animates into place.

      Now released on the first pass that actually computes, one frame later so the corrected
      values paint first. No duration is correct for every page; a rule needs no number.

- [ ] **The flash is not fully eliminated and probably cannot be.** This removes one race. The
      remaining exposure is the window between the custom element upgrading — at which point its
      shadow defaults (50/50 columns, margin -100%) apply — and the first layout pass correcting
      them. Measured at ~70ms here, and invisible, but it is a real interval during which the
      element is painted wrong rather than not painted.

      **The constraint that decides this: do not break existing users.** That matters more than
      optimising the common case, and it rules the obvious option out.

      *Option A — make the defaults the normal layout.* Set `--nav-width` / `--content-width` /
      `--margin` to normal-mode values in `connectedCallback`; it needs `navSize` but not
      `offsetParent`, so it runs before any layout. A wide screen is then right from the first
      frame. **But it is not non-breaking.** Today's defaults are the COMPACT arrangement, so a
      consumer whose sidenav is genuinely narrow — or whose `offsetParent` stays null a while, or
      who has CSS keyed to that initial state — currently paints compact-then-compact and would
      start painting normal-then-compact. That is a new flash for them, traded for one we cannot
      reproduce.

      *Option B — do not paint the guess at all.* Keep every layout value exactly as it is and
      withhold visibility until the first pass has computed. Non-breaking by construction: the
      only observable change is WHEN the element becomes visible, not what it lays out as.

      B's failure mode is the thing to design for: if `handleResize` never succeeds — an
      `offsetParent` that stays null, a `display:none` ancestor, a detached container — the
      sidenav is invisible forever. So it needs a failsafe reveal, and a failsafe IS a timer.
      That is acceptable where the primary mechanism was not, because the worst case becomes
      today's behaviour rather than a component nobody can see.

      Neither is attempted here: the flash does not reproduce on this machine, so any change
      would be unverifiable, and B in particular needs a real reproduction to confirm it improves
      anything rather than just moving the artifact.

## DECIDED: a nav-toggle override does not survive Back

- [x] **Settled 2026-08-30: metadata wins on arrival.** A full-screen page is full-screen
      whenever you arrive at it, by any route — link, Back, or a fresh load. The override is a
      transient viewing choice, not a property of the document, and the nav button is now always
      offered on such a page, so restoring it is one tap.

      Reported as "sometimes the full-screen page and the full-screen page with nav visible look
      like different history entries". Measured, it is neither history nor inconsistent: the
      toggle creates **no** history entry (`history.length` unchanged across repeated toggles,
      URL unchanged). Back simply re-applies the page's declared layout, because `showDoc` resets
      the applied state on every navigation and popstate goes through it.

      **The alternative was real and was weighed.** Browsers restore scroll position on Back, so
      "put the view back how I left it" is an established expectation rather than an exotic one.
      It was rejected because the state would live in `history.state`, which means the same URL
      behaves differently arrived-at-by-Back than clicked — trading the current surprise for a
      new one — and it adds state to a path that has none.

      Both directions have tests (`tests/page-layout.pw.ts`). The Back-to-full-screen one is a
      contract tripwire rather than a regression test: it survives every mutation tried, because
      the paths it walks are covered elsewhere. Its job is to make this decision visible if
      someone reverses it.

## Sub-frame flash of unmeasured prose between `:defined` and hydration

- [ ] Two things constrain `.doc-content`, and there is a gap between them.
      `tosi-doc-system:not(:defined) .doc-content { max-width: var(--doc-content-max-width) }`
      applies until the custom element is defined; the doc-browser's inline `max-width` applies
      once it runs. In between, neither does, and the content is full width.

      Surfaced as a one-off webkit test failure (`content: 1400` on a prose page) while adding
      the `layout` tests — the measurement landed in the gap. The test now waits for hydration,
      which is right for the test and does nothing for the page.

      Likely invisible in practice, but it is the same class as the nav-hydration flicker fixed
      in 1.7.3, and that one was also "probably too fast to see" until someone saw it. Cheapest
      fix is probably for the pre-hydration rule not to depend on `:not(:defined)` — the
      variable is what carries the measure, so a plain `.doc-content` rule would hold across
      the whole load.

## DONE (1.12.1): `<tosi-table>` torn render on a mid-flight `columns` change

- [x] **[#102](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-ui/issues/102)** — fixed. Not the
      mechanism first assumed: `render()` already passes one `cols` array to both the header
      and the row template, so a render cannot tear itself. The break was `setColumnWidths()`
      reading LIVE `visibleColumns` while a render was in flight, writing a grid template for
      the new columns over the old cells. Fewer tracks than cells means CSS Grid auto-places
      the surplus into implicit tracks, which size to content — so header and body resolved
      them differently and stepped apart.

      Found by fuzzing an invariant, not by reasoning: four plausible mechanisms were
      reproduced first and all four held. The invariant — grid track count equals cell count
      in the header and every body row — is now `tests/table-columns-inflight.pw.ts`.

## Flaky: firefox, `no WebAssembly compiler available`

- [ ] Roughly **1 full run in 6, firefox only**, under the same 171-spec parallel load as the
      flake above. The inline-WASM example fails to load at all
      (`✗ example loads without error: Error: no WebAssembly compiler available`), which fails
      `example-bake.pw.ts` slice 2b and the whole doc-test tier in `doc-tests.pw.ts`.

      **Filed upstream: [tjs-lang#36](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/36).** A
      `wasm {} fallback {}` block should take the fallback branch when the engine declines to
      compile wasm — that branch exists for exactly this case. There is **no local fix**: our
      doc-test guard could learn to state its precondition, but the example itself throws
      before the guard runs, so patching the guard would fix nothing while adding a branch
      that can never be exercised.

      Verified before filing, so this is not written off as "the machine was busy": a probe of
      `typeof WebAssembly`, `WebAssembly.validate()` and `new WebAssembly.Module()` run 12×
      per engine **during a full-load run** came back available/valid/compiling **36/36**, and
      the specs pass 3/3 in isolation on firefox. So wasm is normally fine in this lane and
      this is an intermittent refusal under pressure, not a configuration.

## From the 1.11.0 nine-lens review (deferred)

Full report: [RELEASE-REVIEW-1.11.md](RELEASE-REVIEW-1.11.md). All three blockers and eight
majors were fixed before tagging. What is left is performance and process:

- [ ] **M8 — one keystroke rebuilds the whole table.** `crud.render()` unconditionally
      reassigns `table.array`, and `TosiTable.render()` is a full teardown (`textContent = ''`).
      Measured: 3 search keystrokes → 3 full rebuilds inside the debounce window. Any
      in-progress cell edit loses focus and caret. Fix: identity-guard the assignment
      (`if (this.parts.table.array !== this._rows)`), likewise `form.schema`.
- [ ] **M9 — schema-form is O(N²) per keystroke.** One root-scoped attribute `querySelector`
      per field (×2), and `render()` walks the tree three times. Measured under 4× CPU
      throttle: 1000 fields ≈ 145ms per keystroke inside crud, 2000 ≈ 540ms. Validation itself
      is ~0.1ms — the cost is the selector passes. Fix: a `Map<path, {wrapper, control,
errorSlot}>` populated in `buildField`, and memoize `expanded()` once per render.
- [ ] **M14 — no open issue has a disposition.** #97 and #95 are fully implemented and still
      open; #44's Part A shipped whole and Part B (generalized source write-back) needs
      splitting out; #85 and #3 are half-delivered; #87/#88/#89 were filed against the very
      feature this release ships and have no reply. Systemic: #50 and #77 are still open
      despite the 1.10.2 notes claiming both fixed.
- [ ] **M15/M16 — write-backs to `tosijs-coding-practices`.** The shared KB still states the
      `Bun.build()` arena leak as live (this release measured it fixed in bun 1.4.0), still
      says bun#34053's fixes "sit as open PRs", and `review.md` tells you to file review
      reports into `docs/` — which `buildSite` `rm -rf`s on every build, as `deployment.md`
      says 180 lines away. Also: a `./*` exports wildcard does not cover `./*.js`; and the
      localization lesson (a bare word is a question the translator answers wrong about half
      the time) belongs in `web-components.md`.
- [ ] **[#102](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-ui/issues/102) — `<tosi-table>` header
      and body widths can disagree** after a resize followed by a programmatic `columns`
      assignment. Not reproduced yet; the mechanism is narrowed in the issue. The invariant to
      assert is that header and body derive geometry from ONE source — anything computing a
      width per element is a second source and is where this class of bug lives.

## Components

### `<tosi-b3d>`

- Converting this to a blueprint

### `<tosi-filter>`

- Leverage `<tosi-select>` for picking fields etc.
- Leverage `<tosi-tag-list>` for displaying filters compactly
- Leverage `popFloat` for disclosing filter-editor

### `<tosi-editable>`

- Add support for disabling / enabling options
- Hide lock icons while resizing
- Maybe show lines under locks indicating the parent
- Support snapping to sibling boundaries and centers

## CSS variables in the 1.11.0 components

- [ ] `<tosi-schema-form>` and `<tosi-crud>` hand-roll raw `var()` strings (12 sites and 6
      sites) rather than `vars.*` / `varDefault.*`, which CLAUDE.md's CSS rules call for. One
      real bug came out of that and is fixed — `--tosi-spacing-50` is not a variable; the scale
      is `-xs/-sm/-lg/-xl`, and the fallback made the mistake invisible. The remaining three
      (`--tosi-error`, `--tosi-border`, `--tosi-border-radius`) are genuinely new customization
      points, now documented on the schema-form page, but they should go through `varDefault`
      like everything else so a typo cannot hide behind a fallback again.

## Dev bridge (tunnel + magic link)

From two weeks of using the bridge in anger. It is better than Bonjour or a LAN IP when it
works — no address to find, no same-network requirement — and it is the only thing that
affords remote testing at all. The remaining friction is the credential, not the transport.

- [x] **Reusable link window — shipped.** `linkPolicy` defaults to `'window'`: a link is
      redeemable **repeatedly** until it ages out, and only then hands over the durable
      session cookie (30 days). Try something in the Claude app, then open the same link in
      Safari for a deeper dive. TTL is **5 minutes** as of 1.11.0 (`LINK_TOKEN_TTL_MS`),
      configurable per project via `preview.tunnel.linkTtlMinutes` — tightened from 15
      alongside the 7-character token, where the short window is what pays for the short code.
      _(This bullet said "currently 15 minutes" for a while after the change landed one bullet
      below it — a ticked item written in the present tense goes stale silently.)_

- [x] **DONE — [#97](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-ui/issues/97): the link token is
      7 Crockford base32 characters.** Was 22 characters of mixed-case base64url, typed by
      hand into a headset's floating keyboard — painful enough that people abandoned the
      tunnel and typed LAN IP addresses instead, which is the feature failing rather than
      the user. Crockford excludes `I L O U`, so the `0`/`O` and `1`/`l` mistypes cannot
      happen; case is folded and the aliases accepted **on redemption**, and hyphens ignored,
      so someone who types what they think they saw still gets in. `--link` prints the code
      on its own line as well as in the URL. TTL 15 → 5 min, which is what pays for the
      shorter token. The SESSION token is untouched at 128 bits.

      One correction to the issue for the record: it describes the link as single-use.
      It had not been since 1.10.0 — `linkPolicy` already defaulted to `'window'`.

- [ ] **Let the preview index build the edit URL for you.** `dev.tosijs.net` already knows
      every deployed project and its route (`deploy/build-index.sh` scans
      `/srv/preview/*/version.json`). Add a picker plus a 7-character token box that
      composes `https://<project>.edit.dev.tosijs.net/?t=<TOKEN>` and navigates on Enter.

      Same motivation as #97 and the same measure of success: what a headset owner has to
      type. Choosing a project from a list and entering seven characters is a different
      activity from transcribing a full URL through a floating keyboard, and it is the
      difference between testing on interesting devices and not bothering.

## Build System

- **Built-in custom icon generation for `tosijs-ui/site`** — currently a consumer
  generates an icon module with the shipped `tosijs-make-icons` CLI and registers
  it via `defineIcons` in their bundle entry. Make it first-class: export
  `generateIconData({ input, output })` from `tosijs-ui/site` (refactor
  make-icon-data's core into an importable function, CLI as a thin wrapper) so it
  can run from a doc-site `prebuild` hook with no shelling out. Possibly a config
  field (`icons: { input, output }`) that the orchestrator runs automatically.
- ~~Better leveraging of tree-shaking~~ (unbundled ESM output, sucrase as peer dep)
- **Migrate CDN-loaded libraries to peer deps** — now that ESM output is unbundled, these can be normal imports (tree-shaken when unused):
  - `<tosi-code>` — replace ace editor with CodeMirror. **Now a green-lit 1.7 effort** (potentially breaking) — also brings first-class tjs in live examples (highlighting + runtime-value autocomplete via tjs-lang's `editors/codemirror` export) and inline-WASM examples (runtime already works — spiked). Plan + viability + effort in [codemirror-tjs-1.7-plan.md](codemirror-tjs-1.7-plan.md). Better touch support is a bonus (ACE is painful on touch devices).
  - `<tosi-b3d>` — `@babylonjs/core` as optional peer dep (currently loads via `scriptTag` from CDN)
  - `<tosi-lottie>` — `lottie-web` as optional peer dep (currently loads via `scriptTag` from CDN)
  - `<tosi-map>` — `mapbox-gl` as optional peer dep (currently loads via `scriptTag`/`styleSheet` from CDN)
