# highlight-block

`<tosi-highlight>` pretty-prints a static code sample. It is **not** an editor — for that
use [`<tosi-code>`](/code-editor/), which wraps CodeMirror and weighs accordingly.

Use this when code arrives at runtime: a fetched snippet, a generated example, an API
response, a chat message. If the code is in your markdown, you do not need this at all —
`tosijs-ui/site` highlights static fences **at build time**, so the tokens are already in the
pre-rendered HTML, the ePub and the printed page, where a runtime component could never
reach them.

```html
<tosi-highlight language="rust" style="display:block"></tosi-highlight>
```
```js
const block = preview.querySelector('tosi-highlight')
block.value = `fn main() {
    let greeting = "hello";
    println!("{}", greeting);
}`
```

Set `value` (the source) and `language` (a fence-style name — `js`, `ts`, `rust`, `python`,
`bash`, `yaml`, …). Grammars load on demand, so a page pays only for the languages it shows,
and an unknown language renders as plain, readable code rather than failing.

## Styling

Token colours come from the doc-system stylesheet's `.token.*` rules, which derive from the
theme — so highlighting follows a re-themed site and dark mode is a recomputation rather than
a second palette. Outside a doc site, style `.token.keyword`, `.token.string` and friends
yourself, or import the doc-system CSS.

This element renders in the LIGHT DOM deliberately: token styling has to be reachable from a
page stylesheet, and a shadow root would make every consumer re-declare the palette.

    Staleness is guarded by comparing the SOURCE, not by a render counter. A counter was the
    first attempt and it deadlocked: every render bumped it, so a render arriving while the
    grammar was in flight invalidated the callback, and with renders arriving steadily nothing
    ever applied — the grammar loaded and nothing happened, with no error to find. Comparing
    the value asks the question that actually matters ("is this still the code on screen?"),
    is idempotent, and cannot be starved.
