/*
Syntax highlighting for STATIC code blocks — the ones that are not live examples.

Before this, display-only code was highlighted nowhere: the pre-rendered page emitted a bare
`<pre><code class="language-ts">`, the client never touched it, and the ePub stripped the
language class entirely. A doc system that publishes a book had no highlighting in the book.

Two properties shape the design.

**It runs at BUILD time, not only in the browser.** A component that highlights on hydration
reaches neither the ePub (readers may not run JS at all), nor print, nor a no-JS reader, nor a
search engine — which is most of where static code is read. So the primary path is a pass over
rendered HTML during the build, emitting `<span class="token …">` that needs only CSS.

**The client pass SKIPS already-highlighted blocks.** `renderDocMarkdown` is deliberately the
one renderer for build and client so the static page hydrates byte-identically; highlighting
as a separate DOM pass keeps that true. The build's HTML already contains the tokens, the
client sees them and leaves them alone, and only client-side navigation to a freshly rendered
page does any work.

Prism rather than reusing CodeMirror, which we already ship: #120 is an open issue about
CodeMirror being in every IIFE at 94% of the bundle, and routing static highlighting through
it would deepen exactly the dependency that issue wants to escape. Prism's core is ~2kb and
grammars load per language, which also covers the languages a prose or book corpus uses and
CodeMirror does not bundle (shell, python, rust, json, yaml, diff).

The first version kept a `Set` of grammars it had started loading and returned false on a

grammar already in the set and returned false for a language that was loading perfectly well.
Observed exactly that, from a component and a test asking for `rust` at the same moment, and
the symptom is a code block that stays plain with no error anywhere to find.

Caching the promise makes concurrent callers await the same load and get the same answer,
