/*
THE ONE RULE for "does this fence become a live example?"

Two places need the answer and they must agree:

  - `insertExamples` (client) turns matching blocks into `<tosi-example>`;
  - `highlightHtml` (build) must NOT touch those blocks, because a live example reads its
    source out of the `<code>` element and syntax-highlighting it replaces that source with
    `<span class="token …">` markup.

They did not agree for one build. The static highlighter tokenized the `html` fence of every
grouped example, `insertExamples` then read spans instead of markup, and seven doc tests
across two pages failed with "Expected 0 to be 4" and a null `querySelector` — an example that
rendered nothing, reported as a broken component rather than a broken pipeline.

This module exists so the rule cannot be stated twice again. It is deliberately tiny and
dependency-free so both the build and the browser can import it.
