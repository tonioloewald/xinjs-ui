/*
Reading the build lock is part of the PUBLIC surface, not an internal detail (#117).

A consumer writing `bun run stop` needs to answer "is a server already running for this
project, and which process is it?" — and the honest answer lives in the lock file this
package writes. Without these exports the only routes were an internal path (`blocked by the
exports map`) or re-deriving the lock path locally, which means copying the FNV-1a hash of
the resolved root. That copy is the dangerous option: if the hash ever changes, the consumer
reports "nothing running" WHILE a server runs — a silently wrong answer, which is precisely
the failure this whole area exists to prevent. Exporting the reader is what makes the safe
choice also the easy one.

Syntax highlighting for static code blocks.

`registerGrammar` is the seam for a language that ships its own Prism definition — tjs-lang
generates one for TJS from the same source that emits their TextMate grammars (#155), and
hardcoding it in our alias table would put their grammar behind our release cadence.

Registered grammars are used by the BUILD-time pass too, so they reach the pre-rendered page,
the ePub and print — not just a hydrated browser tab. That matters more than usual here: a
wrong token colour is cosmetic on the web and permanent in a printed book.
