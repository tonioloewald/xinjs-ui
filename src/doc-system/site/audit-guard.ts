/*
Dependency-audit gate for the doc-site build and dev server.

`bun audit` knows the registry advisory database; nothing in this build ever
asked it. So ask it, once, at the point a human is looking: the initial build
and the dev-server launch. A high-or-worse advisory FAILS the build — unless the
specific advisory is explicitly gated with a reason AND an expiry date, which
forces it back onto the table instead of being silenced forever.

Design notes that mirror `preflight.ts`:

  - Returns a result; NEVER `process.exit`. This is reachable through the public
    `tosijs-ui/site` export, and library code does not get to kill a caller's
    process from inside a health check. `buildSite` turns a blocking result into a
    failed build; the dev server (which by then owns a running process on which the
    finding is the whole point) is the one place that self-terminates — same
    precedent as the memory watchdog.
  - Fail-OPEN on inability to check (offline, registry down, `bun` too old): a
    dependency advisory you couldn't fetch must not ground you on a plane. Fail-
    CLOSED on an actual finding.
  - NOT downgraded in CI. Unlike the machine-health preflight — a heuristic about
    someone's local box — an advisory is deterministic and environment-independent,
    so CI is exactly where you want the gate to bite.

`bun audit` is itself a subprocess, so shelling out already satisfies the "never a
native-heavy API in a long-lived process" rule. Build-time only (Bun/Node APIs);
never import this from browser code.

Classifying the NATURE of an advisory (not the risk).

The CVSS vector's impact triad is a formal, machine-parseable statement of what
kind of harm is possible, so "can this leak/alter data?" vs "can this only exhaust
resources?" IS deterministic. What is NOT deterministic is whether the vulnerable
path is reachable in OUR usage — CVSS scores the worst case, context-free, and no
field encodes "we only feed this our own globs."

So this classifies, and NOTHING ELSE. Every finding at/above the threshold still
blocks; the label just lets a developer triage in seconds instead of opening four
browser tabs. That matters more than it sounds: measured against a real 44-advisory
set, 20% carried NO CVSS vector at all — and those skewed severe (4 high, 2
critical). A design that auto-softened on classification would have been flying
blind on exactly the worst ones. Annotating costs nothing when it can't classify;
softening would have.

What sync DOES introduce is a hang: a captive portal, a VPN coming up, or a
registry black-holing the connection makes a fetch that never returns, and a build
that hangs forever is worse than one that skips a check. So bound it — on timeout

"Audit ONCE per process, never on a watch rebuild" is the real invariant, and it

it: `doc-site-system.md` tells you to hand `devServer` a `{ build }` that calls
`buildSite(config)`, with no `skipAudit`, so every keystroke rebuild fired a
registry round-trip — a network call in the edit loop, and offline dev broken, for
anyone who followed the docs.

Own it here instead. The first real audit in a process is remembered and every
later call returns it, so the invariant holds no matter how many callers there are
or which of them forgot a flag. `skipAudit` still short-circuits earlier (it avoids
even the first call), and an injected `runAudit` always re-runs — tests need to
