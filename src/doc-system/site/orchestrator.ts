/*
Build orchestrator for the static doc-site system.

`buildSite(config)` runs the full pipeline:
  prebuild — config.prebuild() hook, extract docs, copy static assets
  build    — (optional library tsc), hydration bundle, llms.txt,
             static-site generation, burned-in theme stylesheet

NOTE: keep heavy/icon imports OUT of this module's static graph. generate-css
runs as a SEPARATE subprocess on purpose — importing the full tosijs module or
the icon system here would put src/icon-data.ts into `bun --watch`'s graph and
cause an endless rebuild loop.

  The RETURN VALUE — should a one-shot build exit zero? That additionally requires a

  Conflating them (one flag, `!libraryBuildFailed`, also driving the restore) meant one
  unrelated type error anywhere in src/ deleted a perfectly good site and pinned the
  output to the last-good copy for the WHOLE editing session — the exact opposite of the

      This used to be unconditional, on every `buildSite` — including from `devServer`, and
      including for projects that configure no library build at all. `dist/` is not a site
      artifact: for the repos this API exists to serve, it is the **published package
      output**, an input to `npm publish`. Wiping it destroys build products the current run
      does not rebuild.

      What it cost, reported from tosijs: two bundles (`module.debug.js`, `module.safe.js`,
      exposed as the `./debug` and `./safe` subpath exports) are produced only under
      `--build`, because they need a 53-file transpile too slow for the dev loop. So
      `bun start` — or Playwright's `webServer`, which runs it — wiped `dist/` and rebuilt
      only five of seven. A publish from that tree ships two subpaths that throw
      `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, and their release checklist walks straight into it: build at
      step 3, browser tests at step 4, publish at step 8. It reached a commit once already.

      Nothing local could catch it: size and smoke gates iterate the bundles the current run
      BUILT, so a bundle that was deleted rather than skipped is invisible to both.

      The doc `outputDir` wipe is fine and stays — that directory is wholly generated and the
      build announces it. `dist/` is different, so the rule is now "clean only what you
      wholly generate":

        - `emitLibrary` / `libraryTsconfig` — tsc emits the complete set, so a clean is safe
          and keeps stale artifacts from surviving a rename.
        - `libraryBuild` (a consumer function) — NOT cleaned. The consumer owns the
          directory and may legitimately emit a subset, which is exactly the reported case.
        - nothing configured — NOT cleaned. Nothing here owns it.

      Incidental win: `emitLibrary` runs `tsc --incremental`, whose `.tsbuildinfo` lives in
      `dist/`. Wiping it every run meant incremental compilation never once did anything.
