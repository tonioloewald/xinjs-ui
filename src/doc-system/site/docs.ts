# docs

Utility for extracting documentation from markdown files and inline comments in source code.

> `docs.ts` is intended to be run directly using `bun`. You can transpile it to javascript if you
want to run it using node.

This is used by the `doc-browser` component to build searchable, navigable documentation
from your project's source files.

## Usage

    import { extractDocs } from 'docs'

    extractDocs({
      paths: ['src', 'README.md'],
      ignore: ['node_modules', 'dist', 'build']
      path: 'public/docs.json'
    })

## API

### `extractDocs(options)`

Scans directories for markdown files and source code comments.

**Options:**
- `paths`: Array of directory paths or file paths to scan
- `ignore`: Array of directory names to ignore (default: ['node_modules', 'dist'])
- `output`: if provided, path to write json result.

**Returns:** Array of `Doc` objects

### `Doc` object structure

    {
      text: string,        // Markdown content
      title: string,       // First heading or filename
      filename: string,    // Just the filename
      path: string,        // Full file path
      pin?: 'top' | 'bottom'  // Optional pinning for sort order
    }

## Documentation Format

### Markdown files

Any `.md` file will be included in its entirety.

### Source code comments

Multi-line comments that start with `/*#` will be extracted as markdown:

    /*#
    # My Component

    This is documentation for my component.

    ```html
    <my-component></my-component>
    ```
    ```js
    console.log('hello world')
    ```
    ```css
    my-componet {
      color: blue
    }
    ```
    *‎/

    export class MyComponent extends Component {
      // implementation
    }
    ...

The [doc-browser](/?doc-browser.ts) will render the output as a test-bed project with documentation and live examples.

### Metadata

You can include JSON metadata in comments to control sorting:

html:
    <!--{ "pin": "bottom" }-->

ts, js, css:
    /*{ "pin": "bottom" }*‎/

This pins the document to the top or bottom of the navigation list. Within a
pin bucket, add `"order"` (a number, lower first; default 500) to rank items —
e.g. `{ "pin": "top", "order": 1 }` above `{ "pin": "top", "order": 2 }`.
*/
/*{"pin":"bottom","parent":"Appendices"}*/

Source extensions whose doc-comment blocks become documentation.

`.tjs` earns its place for a reason worth recording: converting `more-math.ts` to `more-math.tjs`
in tosijs SILENTLY deleted its documentation page (tosijs-ui#108). The build stayed green, and so
did the internal-link check — a page that was never generated is linked from nowhere, so "41
slugs, no 404s" is a pass. The only signal was a slug count nobody asserts on. A project mid-port
loses one page per converted module and hears about it from a reader.

The block syntax is identical across all of these, because a doc block is just a comment. There
is nothing language-specific to support; the list IS the whole feature, which is exactly why
forgetting an entry is silent.

(Written without the closing-delimiter characters spelled out, because putting them in a comment
ends it — the same trap tosijs-ui#70 records for doc blocks, hit again while writing this.)
