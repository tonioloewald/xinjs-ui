The inline ` ```test ` blocks in the doc corpus are the only automated coverage of many
components — including `test('the wasm kernel actually compiled (no silent fallback to
JS)')`, the sole guard on the headline inline-WASM feature. Until now they ran only under
`bun run test-browser`, which drives a haltija Electron: a fragile, not-in-CI lane that
could not even start from a common ambient state.

This runs the same tier through Playwright instead — no haltija, inside the existing e2e
job. The doc-browser's background runner already executes EVERY page-with-tests in hidden
iframes on localhost and resolves `window.__docTestResults` with the totals; we just wait
for it and assert nothing failed. One navigation gates the whole corpus.

Run the whole tier at a given viewport.

Factored because the second call is the point: the tier had only ever run at the runner's
hardcoded 800x600, and a doc-system layout regression at phone width shipped in 1.12.3 and was
found by a reader rather than the suite. Every test ran wide, where the nav and the content show
together and the bug is invisible.

An iframe is a real viewport — verified that `matchMedia('(max-width: 600px)')` matches inside a
390px frame and not a 1200px one — so a narrow pass exercises real layout, not a simulation.

What it does NOT give is touch: an iframe inherits the host's input characteristics, so
`(pointer: coarse)` stays false and `maxTouchPoints` stays 0 whatever the size. Faking those by
redefining `navigator.maxTouchPoints` would be worse than skipping it — the property would lie
while the media queries told the truth. Touch belongs to a Playwright context (`hasTouch`,
`devices[…]`), not to this runner.

  // never ran at all); it does NOT indicate a broken example — chromium+firefox run all

  Three separate vacuity guards, because "green" has three different ways of being a lie here
  and only the first was covered.

  The corpus HAS test pages — otherwise this whole lane gates nothing, and a build that
  dropped ```test extraction would report a serene pass.

  EVERY such page reported — `passed + failed > 0` only proves the runner started. A run that
  silently lost half the corpus satisfies it completely, and that is not hypothetical: the
  false green fixed in 1.14.0 was a page-SELECTION defect (a substring match counted 17 pages
  where 16 had tests). Fixing the selection did not add a guard against the next one.

  Some assertions actually executed — a page can report zero tests.

  Framed by tosijs-platform in #142, from a suite that reported "140 pass, 0 fail" while twelve
  cases had never run: "we didn't look" and "we looked and it's fine" must not produce the same
  output. Their skip-guard printed `[SKIPPED]` and asserted `expect(true).toBe(true)`; a
  reported total is the same comfortable lie one level up.
