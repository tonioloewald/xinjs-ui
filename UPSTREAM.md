# Upstream

Rough edges hit in in-house dependencies, mirrored here so the context stays where we
work. **This file is not a channel** — the GitHub issue on the target repo is. Every
entry below links to its filed issue; an entry without one is a complaint nobody will
ever read. See `tosijs-coding-practices/practices/cross-project.md`.

Mark `✅ RESOLVED (fixed in <pkg>@<version>)` when it lands, and close the issue.

**Review cadence — weekly.** Issues filed outside our control (the ones linked below)
get re-polled **once a week**: check each linked issue/PR for state changes, a merge, or
a released version that carries the fix, then refresh its `Status checked <date>` line
with what moved. A passive tracking doc rots; the heartbeat is what keeps it honest. Any
session that opens this file and sees a `Status checked` line older than ~a week should
re-poll before relying on it. (An in-session weekly cron can nudge this, but crons are
session-only + expire in 7 days — this line is the durable reminder.)

## bun

### ✅ `Bun.build()` native leak (#34053) — FIXED as of bun 1.4.0

Re-measured 2026-08-21 on the real iife entrypoint, 60 sequential in-process builds:

| builds | RSS    | marginal         |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| 10     | 288 MB | 27.6 MB/build    |
| 30     | 385 MB | 3.3 MB/build     |
| 60     | 425 MB | **0.7 MB/build** |

Asymptotic, settling ~425 MB. The old signature was ~5 MB/build **still climbing** at build
40 with no plateau; this converges. A warm cache, not an unreturned arena.

**We are NOT reverting the architecture.** Shelling out to the `bun build` CLI stays, and so
do `memoryLimitMb`, `idleTimeoutHours` and `preflight`. Reasons, so this is a decision rather
than inertia:

- 425 MB of steady-state RSS in a process that lives for days is still worth handing back,
  and a child hands back all of it on exit.
- The guards are not `Bun.build`-specific — happy-dom and `@resvg/resvg-js` retain too, which
  is why the ePub and example-check steps are also children.
- The failure mode was catastrophic twice (136 GB once; three stale servers at 210 GB), and
  the cost of keeping the guards is a subprocess spawn per rebuild.
- **A running dev server keeps the code it loaded at launch** — so a fix in the toolchain does
  nothing for the server someone started yesterday.

Revisit if the subprocess spawn ever shows up as a real cost in the edit loop. Until then the
guards are cheap insurance against the next leak, not just this one.

**Measuring note for anyone re-checking:** a small entrypoint plateaus almost immediately
(~27 MB over 40 builds) and shows neither the old behaviour nor a useful confirmation. The
growth scales with the module graph — measure with a real bundle.

- **[oven-sh/bun#36788](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/36788)** — `Bun.serve()`
  `.stop()` **segfaults** during shutdown of a long-lived server (~8h), faulting on an
  address that decodes to ASCII text (`0x632D656475616C63` → `"claude-c"`) — a string
  dereferenced as a pointer, i.e. use-after-free or type confusion in teardown, not a null
  deref. RSS was flat at 0.34GB, so **not** the `Bun.build` arena growth of #34053.

  **Reported to us by tosijs-3d as tosijs-ui#47**, with the diagnosis essentially done:
  elapsed 28624428ms = 7.95h against our 8h idle timer pinned it to the shutdown branch,
  twice.

  **Not blocking — fixed on our side by not calling it.** `process.exit()` ends the
  process and the OS closes the sockets, so `.stop()` first bought nothing. Worth knowing
  that **`try/catch` is not a mitigation** for anyone who does need a graceful stop: a
  segfault is not a catchable exception, so the only workaround is to avoid the API.

- **Status 2026-08-02: #36377 was AUTO-CLOSED as a duplicate and the ask is now split in two.**
  A dedupe bot flagged it on 07-29 ("add a comment to prevent auto-closure"), nobody did, and it
  closed on 08-02. The dedupe was half right — it bundled two asks and the bot matched one:

  - **Nested / path-scoped `overrides`** → **[oven-sh/bun#6608](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/6608)**
    (OPEN since 2023-10-19, 24 comments). Genuinely the same ask; our remediation use case is
    added there as a comment. **This is the half that bites us.**
  - **`bun audit` scoping by dependency class** → refiled tightly scoped as
    **[oven-sh/bun#36773](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/36773)**. NOT covered by #6608,
    which is about install-time resolutions.

  Both closed/refiled issues carry pointers to each other so the trail survives.
  **Lesson worth keeping: one ask per issue.** A two-ask issue is one a bot can close by matching
  half of it, and the other half goes with it silently.

- **(historical, now closed) [oven-sh/bun#36377](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/36377)** — `bun audit` can't be
  scoped by dependency class (no `--production` / `--omit=dev`, and the JSON carries no
  dev/prod flag or dependency path), and `overrides` can't express a **nested/path-scoped**
  constraint the way npm's `{"foo": {"bar": "1.2.3"}}` / `"baz > qux"` forms do.

  **Why we care.** Both are the same need: _act on a specific dependency path, not a package
  name globally._ Our audit gate (`src/doc-system/site/audit-guard.ts`) deliberately blocks on
  every high+ advisory regardless of dep class — the time-boxed gate makes over-blocking cheap
  and a dev-only dep still runs on the developer's machine — so **we are not blocked on the
  `--production` half**. It would only let a consumer of `tosijs-ui/site` express a different
  policy. The **nested-overrides** half is the one that bites: remediating one transitive path
  currently forces a global pin, which is exactly the broad churn our own gate's due-diligence
  output warns against (every extra package that moves is fresh supply-chain surface).

  **Where it shows up in this repo.** `package.json` `overrides` (`flatted`,
  `brace-expansion`) are global pins for precisely this reason. When nested overrides land,
  revisit them — and any `audit.allow` gate whose reason is "can't pin narrowly" can convert
  from a time-boxed suppression into a real fix.

  **Verified working today (don't regress):** `bun audit` reports on **resolved** versions, not
  declared manifest ranges — an override genuinely clears a finding instead of needing a bogus
  gate. And it is sub-second even on a large tree, which is what makes our synchronous
  blocking gate practical. Related, previously closed: bun#30439 (nested overrides/resolutions).
  Status: **filed 2026-07-29, open.**

- **[oven-sh/bun#34053](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/34053)** — `Bun.build()` leaks
  native memory per call (RSS unbounded, `heapUsed` flat), which kills long-lived watch/dev
  processes. **This has taken the machine down twice.** ~30MB per call, monotonic, invisible
  to `Bun.gc()` and to any JS heap profiler.

  **Status checked 2026-07-27: FIXED UPSTREAM — but not yet in a released bun.** The issue is
  **CLOSED (completed 07-24)**; PR #34054 was closed unmerged and the fix landed via a different
  PR, **[#34502](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/34502)** — "Verified on main at `df84f8db1`:
  sequential `Bun.build()` calls now plateau instead of growing RSS unbounded — freed memory is
  returned to the OS between builds." **BUT the latest released bun is still 1.3.14 (2026-05-13),
  the version we run — so no version we can `bun install` carries the fix yet.**
  (Re-checked 2026-08-02: `npm view bun version` → still **1.3.14**. No release in ~3 months;
  the fix remains main-only. Everything stays as-is.)

  **2026-08-02 — what the next release actually is, and why that changes the plan.** bun is
  pushing hard on **1.4, which is the Rust port**: canary is being revved frequently, and the
  remaining work is edge-case bugs concentrated in **OS integrations**. Two consequences:

  1. **Do NOT spend time on 1.4 canary yet.** Decided explicitly — it is too early, and
     chasing a moving canary on a project that ships a dev server and a build system is how you
     spend a week debugging someone else's port. Revisit when 1.4 is released, not before.
  2. **"Measure when the fix ships" now means measure against a REWRITE.** The #34053 fix landed
     on `main` in the Zig codebase; 1.4 is a different implementation. Its allocator behaviour is
     not a delta on what we measured — it is wholesale new, so every threshold in
     `memoryLimitMb` / `preflight.ts` is calibrated against a runtime being replaced. Re-measure
     rather than assume the guards are either still needed or safely removable.

  **The guards stay regardless, and not because we distrust 1.4.** They are not a workaround for
  one bug — they are an _instrument_ for a class: native memory invisible to the JS heap and to
  `Bun.gc()`, in a process that lives for days. A rewrite can fix every current instance of that
  class and still admit new ones, and the failure mode is a machine that swaps itself to death
  with nothing in a heap profile. An instrument that measures outlives the bug that motivated it;
  the cost is a 60s tick. (The Rust port is reportedly aimed squarely at the class of problem we
  keep hitting as bleeding-edge users — which is a reason to expect _better_, not a reason to
  stop measuring.) Action: watch for
  the next bun release; when it lands, MEASURE (see the two caveats below — Transpiler still not
  covered) before considering reverting any workaround. Until then, **everything stays as-is.**
  Prior detail from 2026-07-20:
  **still NO movement; PR OPEN/unmerged, CONFLICTING.** Prior detail from 2026-07-19:
  **NO movement, PR now stale. Issue OPEN (last touched 2026-07-12);
  [PR #34054](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/34054) still OPEN/UNMERGED and has gone
  `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY` — it now has merge conflicts with base and needs a rebase before it can
  land. Latest released Bun is still 1.3.14 (2026-05-13) — the version we run — so NO released
  Bun has the fix.** (Prior check 2026-07-14 was the same modulo the PR not yet conflicting.)
  Bun reproduced it, and their diagnosis is sharper
  than ours: it is not a malloc leak (LSAN sees ~5KB unreachable) — the memory _is_ freed, but
  **mimalloc never purges it back to the OS** (all growth lands in `[anon:mimalloc]` mappings).

  Two things to hold onto when it does merge:

  - **The PR does not cover `new Bun.Transpiler()`**, which leaks ~40KB per _construction_
    (scales with constructions, not code volume). Construct once, reuse.
  - **Do not revert our workarounds.** The child process costs ~30ms and is immune to the whole
    class of native-arena bugs; the bar for going back in-process is "measurably worth it", not
    "the bug is fixed."

  Our side is defended in `src/doc-system/site/` — shelled-out `bun build`, child-process ePub,
  an RSS ceiling, an idle exit, and a machine-health preflight. See "Not taking the machine down
  with you" in `doc-site-system.md`.

## tosijs

> **The foundational dependency — long unreported against, now no longer.** For most of this
> project friction against tosijs was silently absorbed into hand-rolls instead of being filed;
> #20 (below) is the first real bug filed upstream. Keep the habit: file, don't hand-roll around.

### 🚧 BLOCKING — `withAttributes()` makes downstream `.d.ts` emit impossible (filed 2026-09-04)

**[tosijs#38](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs/issues/38)** · Status checked 2026-09-04 · **blocks the 1.10.0 adoption entirely**

`tsc --noEmit` is clean after migrating; `tsc --declaration` fails **TS2742** on every class
built with `withAttributes` — 34 files, 38 errors, exactly the migrated set. No `.d.ts` is
written for any of them, so we would ship JS with no types for every component.

The mixin returns an anonymous intersection declared in `tosijs/dist/component.d.ts`, and
tosijs's `exports` map (`.`, `./debug`, `./safe`, `./core`, `./state`, `./agent`) has no path
that reaches it — so TypeScript cannot write a portable reference into our declarations.

**Not fixable here.** A named exported base moves the error to the const, verbatim. A `paths`
mapping would emit `import("tosijs/dist/component")` into our `.d.ts`, which our consumers
cannot resolve. Asked for either a named type alias exported from `'tosijs'` (preferred — keeps
`dist/` private) or a `./dist/*` subpath.

The adoption is complete and parked on the **`tosijs-1.10-adoption`** branch: 418 → 0 type
errors, 1300 tests green. Merge it when the upstream fix lands, then raise the peer floor and
record the reason.

**Worth saying plainly: the release itself is good.** 416 of the 418 errors were the mechanical
`static initAttributes` → `withAttributes` move, and **2 were genuine defects the old
`[key: string]: any` index signature had hidden** — one of them a `filter-builder` helper that
had been returning the empty string on every call since it was written (fixed separately on
`main`). Removing that index signature does exactly what it promised.

### Open (waiting on tosijs)

- **[tonioloewald/tosijs#20](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs/issues/20)** — a **light-DOM
  component's `this.parts` resolves to a NESTED instance's parts** (unscoped `querySelector`). A
  light-DOM (`lightStyleSpec`) component that contains nested instances of itself gets the first
  `[part=x]` in DOM order — a child's — instead of its own. **Confirmed 2026-07-27**: on the
  self-hosting `one-source-every-artifact` demo, the container `<tosi-example>`'s
  `parts.codeEditors.closest('tosi-example') !== itself`, so its `showCode()` un-hides a nested
  example's editor (actions pipe to the wrong component). Pre-existing — surfaced, not caused, by
  the pocket-bar toolbar move to top-right. Shadow-DOM components are naturally scoped, so this is
  light-DOM-only.

  **Update 2026-07-27 — tosijs 1.7.6's fix was OVER-AGGRESSIVE; DEPRECATED, pinned to 1.7.5.** The
  1.7.6 fix stopped part collection at _every_ nested custom element — which also excludes elements
  the parent legitimately **assigned** a part to but placed _inside_ a nested component. tosijs-ui
  does exactly that: the `<tosi-code>` editors carry `part="js|html|css|test"` but live inside a
  `<tosi-tabs>`, and `testsCheckbox` lives inside `<tosi-pocket-bar>`. On 1.7.6 `this.parts.js`
  went undefined and `showCode()` threw **`elementRef "js" does not exist!`** — every code
  editor / view-edit-code / edit-in-window broke (plain-HTML examples, which don't open an editor,
  were unaffected). The user is **deprecating 1.7.6 and re-fixing** the scoping (it must exclude a
  nested component's _own_ parts but keep parts the parent assigned to slotted/placed content).
  **We pinned tosijs `1.7.5` (dev + peer `^1.7.5`)** — the last solid version.

  **Update 2026-07-27 — 1.7.7 ALSO deprecated (a second, different regression).** 1.7.7 re-fixed the
  parts scoping correctly (self-healing parts: seed from content pre-hydration, absorb lazily-added
  parts on access — verified all three cases: editor-in-tabs, the original nested mis-routing, and
  inline default). BUT 1.7.7's **render-timing / computed-getter change broke `<tosi-segmented>`** on
  **Firefox + WebKit** (Chromium fine): after clicking a segment the value updates but the highlight
  stays on the previously-selected one. Mechanism — segmented's `render()` rebuilds its `<label>`s
  from the `values`/`isOtherValue` getters and relies on a one-shot `valueChanged` flag to _skip_
  that rebuild right after a click; on 1.7.7 the skip no longer holds on FF/WebKit and a rebuild
  re-derives `checked` from a stale getter. Passed on 1.7.0; broke on 1.7.7. **Handed to tosijs; the
  user is deprecating 1.7.7 too and fixing the render timing** (likely affects more than segmented —
  any interaction-vs-render assumption). **Still pinned `1.7.5`.** Re-bump to the next corrected
  tosijs, then re-run the FULL Playwright lane (Chromium-only CI would have shipped this).

  **Update 2026-07-27 (part 2) — 1.7.7 has TWO distinct problems; the anti-pattern half is now
  fixed our side, the other is still tosijs's.** tosijs argued (correctly) that the components were
  depending on `render()` being **skipped** (the one-shot `valueChanged` flag) — an anti-pattern
  1.7.7 merely exposed. We removed it from all three offenders (`segmented`, `color-input`, `form`):
  `render()` is now idempotent (reconcile-in-place / check-before-write, skipping only _provably
  redundant_ work — colours compared parsed so `#rrggbb ↔ rgba()` doesn't clobber the caret). That
  hardening is committed and green **9/9 on 1.7.5** (all browsers) and fixed pre-existing FF
  flakiness + focus-loss-on-click. **BUT** re-testing the hardened components against **1.7.7** shows
  a _second, deeper_ regression the hardening cannot touch: after a click, `input.checked` is
  correct (`['no']`) yet **`this.value` is STALE (`'yes'`)** — the **change handler** commits a stale
  value, not a render-skip issue. So **un-deprecating 1.7.7 as-is would STILL break segmented** even
  with hardened components. tosijs needs to fix the change-event/render interaction (value staleness
  in the handler) in addition to the parts fix, before 1.7.7 (or a successor) is safe. **Filed as
  [tonioloewald/tosijs#21](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs/issues/21)** with concrete repro
  steps (`segmented.pw.ts:7` on webkit/firefox: `input.checked` correct, `this.value` stale). The
  user is adding test coverage tosijs-side.

  **CSS half — DONE.** The live-example's state-class rules now use
  `:host.-STATE > [part="example"] > [part="exampleWidgets"]` child chains (a container example's
  state can't tint a nested handle). Kept across the version churn; independent of the tosijs fix.
  On 1.7.5 the original nested mis-routing itself remains until the fixed tosijs lands (the demo
  self-isolates enough that it's not user-visible right now).

### Note — experimental `tosijs/debug` + `tosijs/safe` builds are METADATA-ONLY in 1.7.0

Checked 2026-07-20 against tosijs **1.7.0-beta.1**. tosijs ships two experimental tjs-built
bundles — `tosijs/debug` (`configure({throwTypeErrors:true, logTypeErrors:true})` + a console
banner) and `tosijs/safe` (same, flags `false`). **Verified empirically that they check
NOTHING yet**: with `tjs-lang/runtime` installed first (`installRuntime()` — importing the
module alone does NOT self-install `globalThis.__tjs`) and config maxed to `safety:'all',
throwTypeErrors:true`, assigning a string to a numeric observable neither threw, recorded, nor
errored (`records=0 errors=0`, value silently became the string). Confirmed structurally: the
debug bundle contains ZERO enforcement-call markers (`checkType`/`checkFnShape`/`emitRuntimeWrapper`)
— config can't switch on code that wasn't compiled in. The bundle's own banner says so:
"Ships runtime type metadata (`__tjs`) per function; **runtime type enforcement arrives as
modules move to native TJS (tosijs 2.0)**." The state-update type-checking + flight-recorder
integration lives on the **tosijs 2.0 branch**, not 1.7.0.

**Consequence:** do NOT build `tosijs-ui/debug` / `/safe` parallel distributions yet — they'd
cost ~1.4MB tarball (one mirrored ESM tree, since debug/safe differ only by a `configure()`
call + banner — same build) and find zero bugs. Revisit when 2.0 wires enforcement; the two
prerequisites are already scoped: (1) a single-tosijs-instance mirror so tosijs-ui can consume
the experimental build without dual-registry collisions, and (2) tosijs-ui feeding
`__tjs.record()` for things WE control (live-example failures, wasm fallbacks). The recorder
API itself works today (`record()` → `records({source,severity})` round-trips). Not filed —
it's a roadmap sequencing note, not a bug.

- **[#13](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs/issues/13)** — ✅ **RESOLVED (fixed in
  tosijs 1.6.9).** Both asks landed: `hydrate()` now ends with `_hydrated = true, _parts =
undefined, _resolveHydrated?.()` — it **invalidates the cached proxy** (so a pre-hydration
  read can no longer poison it) AND exposes the seam (`get hydrated`, `get whenHydrated`). We
  bumped the floor to `^1.6.9` and **deleted both hand-rolls** — `code-editor.ts` and
  `live-example/component.ts` now use the inherited `this.hydrated`. Verified: a pre-hydration
  `parts` read no longer bricks the editor; 628 unit + 39 Playwright green. Original finding:

  **(a) the `parts` proxy permanently poisons itself on a pre-hydration access, and (b) there
  is no paved way for a component to know whether it is hydrated yet.** (b) is the deeper one;
  (a) is what makes it
  bite.

  **The lifecycle (verified, because it is easy to assume otherwise):** content is **not**
  injected at construction. `connectedCallback()` calls `hydrate()`, and `hydrate()` is what
  instantiates `content` and attaches the shadow root. On a constructed-but-uninserted element:
  `shadowRoot === null`, `childNodes.length === 0`, and `parts.<anything>` throws. There is no
  parts DOM at all before insertion.

  **The poisoning.** From the shipped source:

  ```js
  get parts() {
    let E = this.shadowRoot != null ? this.shadowRoot : this   // recomputed each call…
    if (this._parts == null) this._parts = new Proxy({}, { get(M, f) { /* …E.querySelector… */ } })
    // …but the Proxy CLOSES OVER the `E` from the FIRST call, and memoizes resolved nodes.
  }
  ```

  So one read before hydration binds the proxy to the light-DOM element **forever**. After
  insertion the shadow DOM is correct, yet `el.parts.host` still throws
  `elementRef "host" does not exist!` — silently, for the life of the element. (Control: an
  element never touched before insertion resolves `parts.host` fine. It is the early read, not
  the timing.)

  **Nobody was "futzing with parts".** `elementCreator()` returns an _uninserted_ element, so
  `const el = tosiCode({…}); el.showingDiff` is idiomatic — and `showingDiff` is an ordinary
  public getter that _internally_ reads `this.parts.diffHost`. That single read bricked
  `<tosi-code>`: CodeMirror never mounted, no error, ever. **The component's own public API
  forces the read**, so "consumers shouldn't touch parts" cannot be the answer — the component
  needs a supported way to know it isn't ready.

  And the obvious way to find out is the trap: a `try { this.parts.x } catch {}` **probe** —
  code trying to _detect_ whether it is safe is the very thing that makes it permanently unsafe.

  **No public seam.** `_hydrated` and `_parts` are both `private`, and `get parts(): T` is the
  only door, so a subclass cannot ask "am I hydrated?" without an `any` cast. We therefore carry
  **two independent hand-rolls in one repo** (`code-editor.ts`'s `_partsHydrated` + `_pendingDiff`
  replay; `live-example/component.ts`'s own `hydrated` getter + `pendingValues` replay). **20
  files in `src/` declare `shadowStyleSpec`**; the idiom silently bricks any of them, and neither
  the types nor a lint rule prevents it.

  **The precedent is already in tosijs.** `connectedCallback` calls `_drainPendingAttrOps()` —
  attributes set before insertion are queued and replayed on connect. That is exactly the shape
  both of our hand-rolls reinvented. The paved path is half-built; it just isn't exposed.

  **Asks:**

  1. **Make the bug impossible.** Invalidate `this._parts` in `hydrate()` (or don't cache the
     proxy until hydrated). Roughly one line, and no consumer has to know anything.
  2. **Pave the hydration check** — a public/protected `hydrated: boolean` (and ideally
     `whenHydrated: Promise<void>`, so parts-dependent work can be awaited rather than
     hand-queued). A component should understand its own lifecycle without an `any` cast.
  3. Failing (1): **throw a clear error** on pre-hydration `parts` access rather than silently
     poisoning the proxy — a loud failure at the point of misuse beats a silent one at a distance.

  (1) + (2) would let us delete both hand-rolls.

### Open (waiting on tjs-lang)

**[#55](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/55) — `DEFAULT_TYPESCRIPT_URL` is an
unpinned major range** (filed 2026-09-06, observed on 0.13.11). `browser-from-ts` defaults the
TypeScript compiler to `https://esm.sh/typescript@5`. Fetched at runtime, so it is in no
lockfile and invisible to `bun audit` — it was the only hop in our live-example chain that was
neither same-origin nor pinned. **Not blocking:** `typescriptUrl` already exists and we pass an
exact version (`TYPESCRIPT_VERSION` in `code-transform.ts`, drift-tested against the installed
compiler). The ask is that the *default* stop being a range, plus a documented same-origin seam
for the compiler — the equivalent of `__TJS_LOCAL_BASE`. Ours: F10a in
`reviews/1.14.0-pre-release.md`.


_**Status checked 2026-08-24.** Latest published tjs-lang is **0.13.2**, and we now ship
`^0.13.1` / dev-pin `0.13.2` (`TJS_VERSION` in `code-transform.ts` moved in lockstep). Re-poll
#9, #11, #13, #14 against 0.13.x — the note below that "no new release carries a fix" described
0.12.0 and is stale by two minors._

> **Why the upgrade was not optional.** `tjs-lang@0.12.0` is **deprecated on npm**, and the
> deprecation text names our own combination: _"tosijs-schema >=1.5.0 breaks the battery atoms'
> output validation in these versions. Upgrade to 0.13.1."_ — while 1.11.0 declares
> `tosijs-schema` at `^1.7.0`. Worse for adopters, `^0.12.0` does not admit 0.13.x (caret pins
> the minor on `0.x`), so anyone on current tjs-lang got a hard `ERESOLVE`. Found by the
> 1.11.0 nine-lens review as M13; tracked as tosijs-ui#98.

- **[#9](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/9) — Passing a non-`wasmBuffer`
  typed array silently copies it on every call.** The wrapper only takes the zero-copy
  path when `array.buffer === wasmMemory.buffer`; otherwise it copies every array in
  _and_ back out per call. Our 100k-particle SIMD demo was **4.4× SLOWER than its own JS
  fallback** — we were benchmarking `memcpy`, not SIMD. Allocating via `wasmBuffer()`
  took the kernel 0.105 → 0.015 ms/step (7×), flipping the result to ~5.9× _faster_.
  _Ask:_ warn in dev when a wasm param receives a non-wasm-memory array.
  **Our workaround:** allocate everything crossing the boundary with `wasmBuffer(...)`,
  guarded (`globalThis.wasmBuffer ? … : new Float32Array(n)`).

- **[#11](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/11) — WASM ready/enable are
  `__`-prefixed globals, not a public API.** 0.9.1 delivered the capability but kept the
  coupling: `__tjs_wasm_ready` (a _function_ returning a promise), `__tjs_wasm_enabled`,
  `__tjs_wasm_pending`. Also `__tjs_wasm_N` is **index-keyed per transpile**, so two wasm
  examples on one page alias each other.
  _Ask:_ export `tjsWasmReady()` / `setWasmEnabled()`; make the artifact name collision-free.
  **Our workaround:** we write against the globals (non-destructively).

- **[#13](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/13) —
  `tjsCompletionSource` is only reachable via `autocompletion({override})`.**
  `state.languageDataAt('autocomplete', pos)` silently returns the **base JS** source,
  which answers `null` for `app.` — so a working feature looks broken. Nearly filed a bug
  against a feature that was fine.
  **Our workaround / the right probe:** drive `tjsCompletionSource(config)(new
CompletionContext(state, pos, true))` headlessly. Never trust `languageDataAt` here.

- **[#14](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/14) — `getMembers` is
  mis-signposted.** `getLiveBindings` already resolves _nested_ paths
  (`app.items.` → array methods), so `getMembers` is only for scopes you can't hand over
  synchronously. We built toward it unnecessarily.

### ✅ Resolved

_Fixed in tjs-lang **0.10.0**. **Status checked 2026-07-20: all four are CLOSED upstream
(closed 2026-07-16) and we now ship 0.11.0 — the bump happened, so the "on bump" actions below
are RECONCILED against the code:**_

- **#10 ✅ done** — `extractTopLevelBindingNames` / `buildScopeCapture` are gone from
  `code-transform.ts`; we use the upstream `tjs-lang/editors` entry.
- **#12 ✅ done** — `code-editor-cm.ts` now `import type { AutocompleteConfig } from
'tjs-lang/editors/codemirror'`; `TjsAutocompleteConfig` is a deliberate stable _alias_ over
  the real type (name stability for our public surface), not a hand-declaration.
- **#15 ✅ decided, NOT adopted** — we kept the pattern-match guard
  (`/^__tjs_wasm_[a-z0-9]+_\d+$/`) rather than `__tjs.records({source:'wasm'})`, because
  `__tjs.records` is not reachable in the doc-system inline-test scope. Deliberate, keep.
- **#16 ✅ CLOSED OUT 2026-07-20 — the probe STAYS; the "can likely simplify" guess was wrong.**
  Verified empirically: `tjs-lang` is an **optional** peer of tosijs-ui
  (`peerDependenciesMeta.tjs-lang.optional = true`), and bundling
  `tjs-lang/editors/codemirror` when it isn't installed is a hard build failure
  (`error: Could not resolve`). `tjsEditorExternal()` guards **"is tjs-lang itself
  present?"** — orthogonal to what #16 fixed (**"does tjs-lang declare its `@codemirror/*`
  peerDeps?"**, its own hygiene, which is what keeps the hoisted CodeMirror copy single).
  Deleting the probe would break every adopter who skips the optional peer — the same
  optional-peer regression class that blocked a prior review. **Do not retry this.**
  Only change made: the two call sites now share ONE probe result
  (`tjsEditorExternals` / `tjsEditorIsBundled`) so the externals list and the post-build
  guard cannot disagree. Rationale is recorded in `orchestrator.ts` at the probe.

_Original per-issue notes:_

- **[#10](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/10) — Export the AST scope
  extractor.** ✅ 0.10.0 exports `collectScopeSymbols` (+ `introspectValue`,
  `scopeCaptureEpilogue`) from the framework-free `tjs-lang/editors` entry. **On bump, delete**
  `extractTopLevelBindingNames` + `buildScopeCapture` (~130 lines) in `code-transform.ts`.
- **[#12](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/12) — `editors/codemirror` ships no
  `.d.ts` / `types` condition.** ✅ 0.10.0 emits `.d.ts` and declares `types`. **On bump, drop**
  the hand-declared `TjsAutocompleteConfig` in `code-editor-cm.ts` for the real import.
- **[#15](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/15) — silent `wasm{}`→JS fallback.**
  ✅ 0.10.0 records it as a `source:'wasm'` warning (`__tjs.records({ source:'wasm' })`), once
  per site. **On bump,** consider replacing the internals-poking inline WASM guard with this.
- **[#16](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tjs-lang/issues/16) — `@codemirror/*` bare imports,
  no peerDeps.** ✅ 0.10.0 declares them optional `peerDependencies`. **On bump,** the
  `tjsEditorExternal()` probe can likely simplify (keep as a belt-and-suspenders until verified).

- **Stale `editors/codemirror` build** (missing `tjsEditorExtension` /
  `tjsCompletionSource`) — ✅ **fixed in tjs-lang@0.9.0**. Unblocked first-class tjs.
- **No awaitable WASM ready signal** — ✅ **fixed in tjs-lang@0.9.1**
  (`globalThis.__tjs_wasm_ready`). See #11 for the API-shape follow-up.
- **No WASM enable/disable toggle** — ✅ **fixed in tjs-lang@0.9.1**
  (`globalThis.__tjs_wasm_enabled`). See #11.
- **`f32x4` had no compare/select/min/max** (masked SIMD impossible) — ✅ **fixed in
  tjs-lang@0.9.1** (`f32x4_lt/le/gt/ge/eq/select/min/max`).

### Not filed (documentation gaps we absorbed)

- int→float coercion is per-binary-op inside `wasm{}`, so `x / w` with two `i32`s does
  **integer** division and only promotes at the next operator. Force f64 early
  (`let fx = x + 0.0`). Now covered by the docs' Numeric Types table.

---

## haltija

- **[tosijs-ui#21](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-ui/issues/21)** (consumer-side tracker;
  haltija-side asks in the comment) — the doc-test lane's `--private` migration is **blocked in a
  plain `bunx haltija` runtime.** Checked 2026-07-20 against **haltija 1.5.0**. The `--private`
  server + port-file + `HALTIJA_PORT` routing all work; launching a browser under it does not:

  - **`--headless` needs Playwright bunx-haltija can't resolve** — logs "Playwright not installed",
    launches nothing. We have `playwright@1.58.2` + chromium, but bunx resolves from its own cache
    and **ignores `NODE_PATH`**.
  - **`--private --app` hits Electron's single-instance lock** ("Another instance is already
    running") whenever another haltija Electron is up — i.e. exactly the scenario the migration
    exists for. Works only when no other haltija Electron exists (the case that never needed it).
  - **Update 2026-07-21 (haltija 1.5.4): isolation now WORKS; teardown is the last blocker.**
    `--private --ci` (Electron, no Playwright) spawns isolated with the shared haltija up
    (`8700/8701 untouched`); the full migration ran GREEN (`33 passed`, exit 0) and left the
    shared browser untouched. BUT `--private --ci` **orphans its Electron** — our teardown can't
    reliably reap it (it reparents; even a manual early-tree reap left survivors). Each run leaves
    an Electron that (a) holds the single-instance lock → next run fails, (b) accumulates (the
    machine-exhaustion hazard). Won't hand-roll a flaky reaper into a safety-critical lane.
    **Filed upstream: [tonioloewald/haltija#7](https://github.com/tonioloewald/haltija/issues/7)** —
    reliable `--private` teardown (an `hj --port quit`/shutdown, or `--private` killing its whole
    process group incl. Electron on spawner-death / wrapper SIGTERM). With that, the migration is a
    few lines. (Blocker A — `--headless` needs Playwright — is moot: `--ci` uses Electron.)
  - **Status checked 2026-07-27: UNBLOCKED — haltija#7 is FIXED in v1.5.5** (latest v1.5.7). The
    private instance now tears _itself_ down: a private run never takes the single-instance lock
    (`gotTheLock = IS_PRIVATE ? true : requestSingleInstanceLock()`) and self-cleans on exit — so
    the orphan/lock cycle that blocked us is gone, and consumers no longer hand-reap a reparented
    tree. tosijs-ui#21 is now **actionable**: redo the `--private --ci` doc-test-lane migration
    (proven green pre-teardown-bug), and **bump the floor `haltija@^1.5.0` → `^1.5.5`** so the fix
    is guaranteed. Prior status (07-21): reverted to shared-adopt, blocked on haltija#7.

- **NOT YET FILED** — haltija's window fires **no animation frames** when backgrounded
  (verified: an `rAF` callback never runs). tosijs's entire render pipeline is rAF-driven,
  so under `hj eval` a _correct_ component never calls `render()`, leaving parts empty and
  measuring 0×0 — indistinguishable from a broken one. This nearly caused a false
  diagnosis of a correct fix during 1.7.
  **Our rule:** `hj` is for **state**, never for **paint**. Use Playwright for anything
  about rendered output, and wait for the frame before measuring.
  _(Needs sign-off to file against a repo outside the current task's scope.)_

- ~~Shipped dev server spawns an **unpinned** `bunx haltija@latest`~~ — **✅ RESOLVED both
  sides.** Our side (2026-07-14): `dev-server.ts` spawns `HALTIJA_PKG` = `haltija@^1.4.0`,
  overridable via `HALTIJA_VERSION`. Upstream: **haltija 1.4.0 delivers the version contract we
  asked for** — every REST response carries `X-Haltija-Version`, `hj --version` exists and warns
  when it differs from the server it drives, a server never overwrites a newer/ symlinked `hj`,
  and pre-1.4.0 servers are retired via `POST /shutdown` on startup (opt out with
  `HALTIJA_NO_INSTALL` / `HALTIJA_NO_RETIRE`). So an embedder's `bunx haltija@<pin>` can no
  longer silently downgrade an unrelated project's CLI — which was the whole hazard.

## tosijs-schema

Filed while designing the schema-driven editing work (`SCHEMA-FORM-PLAN.md`, branch
`schema-form`), against **tosijs-schema 1.4.0** (what `tjs-lang` pulls in transitively;
npm is at 1.5.1).

### ✅ Delivered in 1.6.0

- **[#6](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-schema/issues/6) — `inferSchema(sample)`:
  derive a schema from example data.** `Infer<S>` goes schema → TS type; this is the
  runtime inverse. Requested here rather than built locally because it is a schema
  operation — dependency-free, testable without a DOM — and because **one** inference pass
  would then serve both consumers we have in mind: a `data-table`'s columns and a
  schema-driven form's fields, instead of two that drift.

  It also fixes a latent bug on our side. `data-table` infers columns from
  `Object.keys(array[0])`, so a key absent from the FIRST row loses its column silently.
  Unifying across the whole array is requirement #1 in the issue.

  The requirements worth repeating, because they are where these tools go wrong:
  **structure only** — never infer `minimum`/`maxLength` from a sample, since a sample's
  extremes are not the domain's and inferred constraints reject valid future data;
  `format` and `enum` sniffing **off by default**; deterministic output, because these
  schemas get committed and diffed. Acceptance test: `validate(rows, inferSchema(rows))`
  must pass for the very data it came from.

- **Blocked on [#5](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-schema/issues/5)** (no spelling
  for an intentionally OPEN object). Inferred schemas describe a _sample_, not a contract,
  so they must be `additionalProperties: true` — otherwise `filter()` strips any field that
  happened not to appear. That is not hypothetical: the snowfox `schema-form` we are
  learning from rebuilds output from a schema-shaped view and silently discards timestamps
  and provenance on every save (its `SF-2`). Closed-by-default inference would build that
  same failure in.

- **[#7](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-schema/issues/7) — `inferSchema` labels a
  date-only string `format: 'date-time'`** (confirmed against 1.6.1; to be patched in 1.6.2).
  Self-consistent — their validator accepts it, so the "never rejects its own sample"
  guarantee holds — but `2020-01-01` is not an RFC 3339 `date-time`, so the emitted schema is
  one Ajv and friends would reject against the very data it came from. Only bites when the
  schema **travels**, which is the whole point of emitting plain JSON Schema. Not a blocker
  for us: we use their validator.

### Open

- **[#8](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-schema/issues/8) — `validate` silently
  ignores `oneOf`, `exclusiveMinimum`, and 11 other keywords**, returning `true` for values
  the schema forbids. Found while building slice 4 of `<tosi-schema-form>` (unions) by
  measuring the validator's behaviour before writing against it — the same
  measure-first habit that turned up #7.

  It is a **documented** subset (`ENFORCED_KEYWORDS` is exported, and `agentContract`
  refuses schemas that step outside it, reasoning that "a gate must not fail open"). The
  issue is that plain `validate` fails open on exactly those keywords, with no signal.

  Two of them are not corners. **`oneOf` is how discriminated unions are written in
  practice** — every generator and tutorial emits it, `anyOf` is the unusual spelling — so
  the single most common variant shape is the one where validation is a no-op. And
  `exclusiveMinimum` is an ordinary bound: "strictly positive" accepts `0`.

  The ask, in priority order: enforce `oneOf`; enforce `exclusiveMin/Max`; and **export the
  unenforced-keyword lint** `agentContract` already computes, so a consumer can _warn_
  rather than silently imply a field is checked. Detectability is worth more than coverage.

  **What we do meanwhile:** `<tosi-schema-form>` renders `oneOf` unions (refusing them
  would refuse most real schemas) and carries its own `unenforced.ts` walker so a field
  under an unvalidated keyword says so, instead of showing a green form over an unchecked
  value. Delete that file when (3) lands.

### Watching

- **[#4](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-schema/issues/4)** — 1.5.0 tightened
  validation in a MINOR and broke published consumers on install. Relevant when we take a
  version floor: decide deliberately rather than inheriting whatever `tjs-lang` resolves.

## tosijs — deprecation spam nobody can fix (filed 2026-09-02)

- **[tosijs#31](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs/issues/31) — tosijs warns about its
  own deprecated proxy property.** Every page of every doc site logs `xinValue, tosiValue,
xinPath, tosiPath, etc. are deprecated`, and nothing in the consumer's code causes it.

  **Evidence, so this is not re-derived:** the stack's `Object.get` frame says it is a
  property READ on a proxy, not a call to the standalone function — and all three frames map
  through the sourcemap into `tosijs/dist/module.js`. Ruled out on our side: zero `xinValue`
  in `src`, `demo/src` or the extracted corpus; and measured in-page, `tosiValue(proxy)`,
  `.value` and `.tosi.value` are all SILENT while only `xinValue(proxy)` warns.

  Also flagged there: the runtime message calls `tosiValue` deprecated while `metadata.d.ts`
  marks only `xinValue`/`xinPath` and recommends `tosiValue`. We followed the typings.

  **`bindText`/`bindList` — RESOLVED by un-deprecating both**, which is the right call: they
  are a pair (one supplies the per-item template, the other fills it), and `{ textContent:
  proxy }` was never a replacement for the path form. Measured: `textContent: '^.name'` inside
  a template renders the LITERAL string while `bindText: '^.name'` binds. Raised as
  [tosijs#33](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs/issues/33); our
  [#126](https://github.com/tonioloewald/tosijs-ui/issues/126) is closed with nothing to
  migrate. Not yet in a published version — 1.8.2 still marks both — so verify the console is
  clean when we take the upgrade rather than assuming.

## tosijs — `on<Event>` sugar collides with `on*`-shaped members (recorded 2026-09-03)

Not filed as an issue: it is a **constraint to have on record**, not a defect to ask them to fix.

Since tosijs 1.8.0 the elements factory treats any `on<Event>`-shaped property as event-handler
sugar, so a component that legitimately defines such a member gets a warning the reader cannot
act on. Ours is `<tosi-tabs>`'s deprecated `onCloseTab` alias, kept for compatibility — so both
of upstream's suggested exits (initialise it to a no-op, or rename it) cost us a **breaking
change**, and it waits for our next major.

Worth knowing before that major: this is the one remaining console warning on a doc site, and
the 1.13.0 notes say so plainly rather than claiming a clean console. Related: the CSRF work in
1.13.0 (#90) and tosijs#31/#33 came out of the same "warnings a consumer cannot act on" thread.

## haltija — page → agent push (filed 2026-08-26)

- **[haltija#37](https://github.com/tonioloewald/haltija/issues/37) — no page→agent push.**
  Everything in haltija is agent-initiated; the page cannot tell the agent anything unless the
  agent asks first. The only page-originated flow is `POST /select` (human points at elements),
  which is **poll-based and narrow**. `hj send <agent> <message>` is a different feature — it
  targets an _agent tab_ (`"No agents available - open an agent tab first"`), not the CLI-side
  agent driving the session.

  **Why we care.** `haltijaDev: 'tunnel'` (#104, shipped 1.13.0) gives the agent's half for a
  remote device — `hj eval`/`hj navigate` work against a headset. The human's half is missing,
  and in a headset it is the harder one: you cannot see a terminal or take the headset off,
  because the bug is usually _about_ being in it. Also the GDPR case: a message channel to the
  already-running agent is remote agent interaction with **no third-party routing** — device →
  own tunnel → own machine → own in-region model endpoint.

  **Why a channel, not "let the page spawn an agent":** a web page that can start a process
  with filesystem access is a much bigger grant than a pipe to the agent the user is already
  supervising. Strictly the safer design, which is why it is what we asked for.

  **Refined to a session MIRROR, not a mailbox** (2026-08-26): anything the agent says goes to
  the pipe and is readable from the page; anything the user types on the page goes into the
  session as if typed. Strictly more useful — the person in the headset watches the agent
  _work_, not just its replies — and it is the self-hosted equivalent of a vendor
  remote-control feature, which is the GDPR argument made concrete rather than approximated.

  **The agent needs no API for this**, which is what makes it buildable: a pty wrapper
  (`hj session -- claude`) sees every byte and can inject input by writing the master side —
  indistinguishable from typing, which is how `expect` and `tmux` work — and **tmux**
  (`pipe-pane` / `send-keys`) does both for a session that is _already running_, which a
  wrapper cannot. Suggested tmux first for the headset case specifically: a raw pty mirror is
  ANSI from a full-screen TUI and needs xterm.js to render, while `capture-pane -p` yields
  already-rendered text.

  Flagged for design: a mirror carries everything the agent prints, so it needs its own opt-in
  (same trust boundary as the edit session, which can already write source — consistent, not
  novel, but not something `haltijaDev: true` should imply); and two writers on one pty wants
  line-at-a-time remote input rather than per-character.

  We supply the page-side view once the primitive exists; the transport already works.

- **[haltija#38](https://github.com/tonioloewald/haltija/issues/38) — `component.js` recording
  is broken for every `wss://` config.** `serverUrl.replace("ws:", "http:")` is a no-op on
  `"wss://…"` (the substring is `"wss:"`), so the derived HTTP base is `wss://host` and every
  server-side recording fetch fails. Hits the standard localhost HTTPS path too, since
  `inject.js` sets `wss://localhost:8701/ws/browser`. Found while reading the file for #104;
  does not block it.

### ✅ RESOLVED (fixed in haltija@1.12.6) — our floor moved to `^1.12.6`

_Status checked 2026-08-30._

Closed upstream and shipped. Recorded here because the floor in `dev-server.ts` encodes these
fixes rather than a date, so anyone wondering why it moved has the list:

- **#39 — a `--private` instance now has a lifetime bound.** Exits after 8h idle saying why;
  `HALTIJA_IDLE_TIMEOUT_HOURS` overrides. Polling deliberately does not count as activity, or a
  `--private --app` instance would refresh its own clock from its own UI — which was exactly the
  configuration we reported. This is the one that matters most to us: the instance we found was
  12 days old at 5.7 GB on a box at load 212, and it silently confounded a timing measurement
  here that got blamed on local code.
- **#38 — the `wss://` no-op replace.** One function derives the HTTP base now.
- **#35 / #36 — Electron 40.6.1 → 43.4.1 (two context-isolation bypasses) and the MCP SDK
  re-lock.** We spawn Electron, and context isolation is haltija's security boundary.
- **#33 — HTTPS mixed-content embedding** now documented with a transport-picking loader.
- **Not filed by us but load-bearing for LAN/tunnel work:** served scripts had been handing the
  browser `localhost:<port>`, which in a served script means the BROWSER's machine, so a page
  opened from another device was told to connect to itself. Host is derived from the request
  now — our mkcert certs already cover `<hostname>.local` for exactly this.

Still open, and both still shape how we work:

- **#37 (page → agent push) — the PRIMITIVE now exists.** 1.12.6 ships `hj session
attach/read/write`, the tmux session mirror we refined the ask to, with read and write as
  separate grants. What we said we would supply — the page-side view — is now unblocked, and is
  the remaining half of the headset story alongside `haltijaDev: 'tunnel'`.
- **#41 (foreground window).** Partly mitigated, not fixed: results now carry `paintAgeMs` and
  warn when stale, so a rAF-starved tab is DETECTABLE rather than silently wrong. Getting a
  foreground window cheaply — what the issue actually asks for — is still open upstream.
- **#40 (unauthenticated `/terminal/*` and `/files/write`) — still open, and do not confuse it
  with the fix that DID land.** 1.12.6 fixed `/session/write` ("write is a capability, not a
  mode: reach no longer equals authority") — attach mints an unguessable 48-char handle when
  `allowInput` is granted, returns it once, re-mints on re-attach, and compares it in a
  constant-time-ish loop, so holding the token no longer means holding permission to type into
  the agent. Same word, different endpoint. **`/files/write` is unchanged** — verified in the
  shipped v1.12.6 source, the containment guard is still skipped for absolute paths:

  ```js
  const resolved = body.path.startsWith('/') ? body.path : resolve(baseCwd, body.path)
  const rel = relative(baseCwd, resolved)
  if (rel.startsWith('..') && !body.path.startsWith('/'))   // ← bypassed when absolute
  ```

  The two remaining review recommendations were considered and rejected for stated reasons, so
  the gap is deliberate rather than forgotten: requiring `Content-Type: application/json` (to
  stop these being CORS-simple) breaks 44 of 109 e2e POSTs and haltija's own documented `curl`
  examples, and rejecting cross-site `Sec-Fetch-Site` breaks the widget calling `:8700` from a
  page on `:3000` — which is legitimately cross-site and IS the tunnel case. Both need #40's
  posture decision (loopback default bind + explicit LAN opt-in).

  **What this means for us, at the boundary.** Our `haltijaDev: 'tunnel'` relay is NOT exposed
  by this: it is gated on a live dev session cookie (`mayDriveWithAgent` → `mayWriteSource`),
  relays through our own listener, and 404s unauthorized callers. What is not covered is that
  enabling `haltijaDev` at all means **haltija's own port is running**, and that port is the
  ungated one — a default `bunx haltija` binds beyond loopback with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
*` and no token, where `POST /terminal/command` reaches `spawn('sh', ['-c', cmd])`. Our gate
  protects our relay, not the channel underneath it. `HALTIJA_TOKEN` is the mitigation and only
  became genuinely usable in 1.12.6 (before it, the widget never sent the token, so requiring one
  broke every page-side feature).

- **#32 (open both transports by default)** untouched.
