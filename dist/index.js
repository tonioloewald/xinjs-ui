/*
The DOC-SYSTEM cluster is deliberately NOT re-exported here (tosijs-ui#133).

`code-editor` pulls CodeMirror; `live-example` and `doc-system/doc-system` each pull
`tjs-lang` independently. This package has no `sideEffects` field — correctly, because
`elementCreator()` registers custom elements at import time and a blanket `sideEffects:false`
tree-shakes a bare `import 'tosijs-ui'` down to zero registrations. So a bundler must assume
every re-exported module is side-effectful and cannot drop it, and `export *` made all four
unconditionally eager in any app importing anything from this barrel.

Measured by snowfox-app moving a 15MB React bundle to the bun bundler:

  barrel as shipped                     1.68 MB
  barrel without the four doc modules   0.38 MB   ← the cluster is 77% of the barrel

Measured with, and only comparable to, this exact command — a different `--external` set or
dropping `--minify` moves it by a factor, which is how three different figures for the same
win ended up published at once:

  bun build <entry importing 4 named component creators> --minify --target browser

snowfox-app reported 1.83 MB / 79% on tosijs-ui@1.12.7 against their own bundler config; the
figures above are the local reproduction on this tree. Both are honest; neither is a
reproduction of the other.
  real app bundle, before               15.21 MB
  real app bundle, after                13.86 MB  ← 1.35 MB / 8.9% saved

For contrast the 3D, map and lottie components — the ones you would expect to be the heavy
tail — cost about 10kB from the barrel, because they already lazy-load properly.

All four remain importable by subpath (`tosijs-ui/code-editor`, `/live-example`,
`/doc-browser`, and `doc-system/doc-system` via the `./*` wildcard), which is how the doc
system and `index-iife.ts` now reach them. Nothing needed them here to be importable.

A trap worth recording, from the report: stripping `code-editor` + `live-example` +
`doc-browser` measured EXACTLY ZERO change. `doc-system/doc-system` is an independent second
door into `tjs-lang`, and it is the only one of the four not named in the `exports` map, so it
is the easy one to miss. Anyone re-measuring needs all four or they will conclude the problem
is not real.
