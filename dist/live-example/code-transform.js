The TypeScript compiler a live `ts` example is transpiled with.

tjs-lang's `fromTS` lazy-loads it from `DEFAULT_TYPESCRIPT_URL` — `https://esm.sh/typescript@5`,
an unpinned major range — and that was the ONE hop in the whole live-example chain that was
neither same-origin nor pinned. Everything else routes through `__TJS_LOCAL_BASE` or a
`TJS_VERSION`-pinned CDN. It is invisible to `bun.lock` and therefore to `bun audit`, so
"which compiler ran in a reader's browser" had no answer and could change under us.

Pinned to the exact version this repo type-checks with (`typescript` devDep), so an example
is lowered by the same compiler that validates the source it came from. **Bump the two
together** — the devDep is the source of truth, this is the browser's copy of it.

esm.sh is kept as the host: tjs-lang measured it as the only CDN that reliably serves
typescript as ESM (jsDelivr `+esm` and esm.run time out on its ~10MB CommonJS; skypack is
dead). The fix here is the pin, not the host. A same-origin copy would be better still and is
the upstream ask — tjs-lang exposes `typescriptUrl` for exactly that.
