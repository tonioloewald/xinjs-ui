 * hyphens and left slashes and `@` — so a perfectly ordinary specifier like
 * `'tosijs-3d/demo-utils'` became the parameter name `tosijs3d/demoutils` and every test in
 * that file died with V8's "Arg string terminates parameters early" (tosijs-ui#111/#112).
 * The examples on the same page rendered fine, because THEY used this function. Two copies of
 * one rule, and only one of them maintained.
 *
 * A context key is an import specifier — a string. Nothing about `'@scope/pkg'` suggests it
 * must also be a valid identifier, so this makes one rather than demanding one.

 * a doc test is.
 *
 * A collision THROWS, and deliberately does not quietly rename. `rewriteImports` derives its
 * binding from the same rule, so a suffixed parameter (`tosijs3d2`) would leave one of the two
 * modules bound to a name no rewritten import ever references — importing from it would return
 * undefined, at runtime, with nothing to read. Two specifiers that reduce to one identifier is a
 * genuine ambiguity in the configuration, and the only useful thing to do with an ambiguity is
 * name it. The message is the whole point: "Arg string terminates parameters early" is what this
