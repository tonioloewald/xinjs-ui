/*
Build-time transpile check for live examples.

Every executable code block in the corpus (`js` / `tjs` / `ts` / `test`) is put
through the SAME front half of the runtime pipeline the live-example component
uses — `rewriteImports` → the tjs-lang transform → `new AsyncFunction(...)` — so a
block that can't build is caught *at authoring time*, on every page, instead of
silently rendering an error only when someone opens that page. The two outcomes
are graded differently (this is the point):

  - a real **syntax / transpile error** is broken code → a `problem` that FAILS
    the build;
  - an **unsupported import** (a non-context package, no import-resolver) is fine
    code the doc environment just can't run → a `warning`: the block is treated as
    display-only and the build survives. It's almost always illustrative code that
    should have been tagged `typescript` instead of `ts` — a mistagging shouldn't
    take the whole build down with it.

`html` / `css` and display-only languages (`typescript`, `json`, …) are not
executed, so they're skipped.

Build-time only (bun). Never import from browser code.
