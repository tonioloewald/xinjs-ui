/*
Magic-link auth for the dev server, so a workspace exposed through `bun run tunnel`
can be edited from anywhere.

TWO TOKENS, ON PURPOSE.

  LINK token   — travels in a URL (`https://…/?t=…`). Therefore it is the one that
                 LEAKS: browser history, Referer headers, reverse-proxy access logs,
                 link previews in chat apps that fetch what you paste, and anyone
                 reading over your shoulder. So it is SHORT-LIVED — five minutes — and
                 it is short enough to type: 8 letters, no digits.

                 It is a BEARER token for those five minutes, and that is a deliberate
                 reversal of the single-use rule this comment used to state. Two things
                 bought the change. Single-use meant "glance at the link and close the
                 tab, mint another" and "open it on the laptop, now your phone can't" —
                 the workspace is the thing you read on a phone, so the rule collided
                 with the feature's own purpose, and an adopter routed around it with a
                 never-expiring token of their own. And a 22-character mixed-case string
                 typed into a headset's floating keyboard was painful enough that people
                 gave up and used LAN IP addresses instead. A credential nobody can face
                 using is not protecting anything.

                 ~35 bits is ample for what this is: an ONLINE-only guess against a Map
                 lookup — no offline attack — for a token that is redeemed seconds after
                 it is minted, and which mints nothing but a write session that
                 `mayWriteSource` still gates. At an absurd sustained 10⁴ guesses/sec
                 across the entire five-minute window, P(hit) ≈ 0.01%.

  SESSION token — never appears in a URL. Set as an HttpOnly cookie by the exchange
                 and sent automatically thereafter, so it can be durable without being
                 exposed. This is the one that actually authorises writes.

That asymmetry is the whole design. A single durable token pasted into a URL would be
strictly WORSE than basic auth: it would sit in five different logs forever. Exchanging
it immediately for a cookie, then redirecting to a clean URL, is what makes "just send
me a link" both convenient and defensible.

Cookie flags, and why each:
  HttpOnly          — script cannot read it, so an XSS in a rendered doc cannot exfil it
  Secure            — never sent over plaintext
  SameSite=Lax      — sent on top-level GET navigation (so clicking your link works),
                      NOT on cross-site POST. That last part is free CSRF protection for
                      the write endpoint: another origin cannot make your browser POST
                      to /__docstore/source with your cookie attached.
  Path=/            — the whole workspace, since editing spans the site

Build-time only. Never import this from browser code.

LETTERS ONLY — no digits — and case-insensitive.

The link token is TYPED BY HAND, into a floating keyboard on a headset. Crockford base32 (the
previous alphabet) was already chosen for typo-resistance, and that reasoning was right as far
as it went — but it still contained digits, and **on a headset the letter↔number switch is a
trip to a different keyboard page**. Reported from an XR test session (tosijs-ui#132): two of
the four codes minted that day were `A70MDCD` and `X9Q3Z53` — three digits each in seven
characters, so three round trips to the number page for a code you are gaze-and-pinching one
glyph at a time.

THE EXTRA CHARACTER IS FREE; THE MODE SWITCH IS NOT. Eight characters of a 22-letter alphabet
is 35.7 bits against the previous seven-of-32's 35.0 — so this is very slightly STRONGER while
never leaving the alphabetic keyboard. (The report suggested all 26 letters at 37.6 bits; the
four exclusions below are worth the 1.9 bits, and length is the cheap axis anyway.)

Exclusions, all inherited from Crockford and all still earning their place with digits gone:

  I, L  mutually confusable, and uppercase `I` versus lowercase `l` is indistinguishable in
        most keyboard fonts — which matters MORE here, not less, because the token is
        case-insensitive so the reader cannot use case to tell them apart.
  O     kept out although `0` no longer exists to confuse it with: `O`/`Q` is a real misread
        at headset rendering resolution, and dropping one of the pair is cheaper than a
        support conversation.
  U     Crockford drops it so an unfortunate token cannot spell an obscenity.

Case-insensitivity is not a nicety here either: a headset keyboard that auto-capitalises the
first character would otherwise burn an attempt on its own behaviour.

Guess-rate control: redemption is SERIALIZED, and every attempt takes at least 100ms.

Two lines of policy, and between them brute force stops being a thing that can happen.
Concurrency of one means an attacker cannot parallelise across connections; a 100ms floor
means the whole server answers at most ten redemption attempts per second no matter how many
they open. Against 22⁸ ≈ 5.5 × 10¹⁰ that is ~174 years to exhaust, and within a single
five-minute link window it is ~2,900 guesses — odds of about 1 in 18 million.

(Those figures moved with the alphabet: the token was seven Crockford base32 characters
(32⁷ ≈ 3.4 × 10¹⁰, ~111 years, ~1 in 11 million) before it became eight letters. This is the
one file where the numbers ARE the argument, so they are updated rather than left
conservative-but-stale.)

After **ten consecutive failures the slot widens to a second**, which costs a guesser another
factor of ten and costs a human nothing: nobody mistypes eight characters ten times running,
and if they somehow do, they wait a second. It is still not a lockout — the door never closes,
it only gets slower to knock on.

**No lockout, deliberately.** An earlier version of this escalated the delay and then refused
outright after N failures. Both were unnecessary once the rate is floored, and the lockout
was actively worse: a lockout an attacker can trigger is a denial of service against the
developer, on the one credential they need in order to work. There is no counter to reset, no
threshold to tune, and no state that can be poisoned. What remains is a constant.

**The floor applies to SUCCESS too**, which is the part worth not optimising away. Delaying
only failures would leak the answer through response time and undo `safeEqual`'s constant-time
comparison — the throttle would become the oracle. A uniform floor makes every attempt
indistinguishable from the outside.

**Global rather than per-IP, and that is not laziness.** Every request arriving over the
tunnel comes from LOOPBACK — a reverse tunnel counterfeits "local" by construction, which is
why `mayWriteSource` keys on the listener rather than the peer address. A per-IP limiter would
bucket every remote attacker together with the legitimate user under `127.0.0.1`: it would not
slow the attacker down, and it WOULD get in the developer's way. Global is also the honest
unit, because legitimate redemptions are rare — you mint a link and type it once, maybe twice.

100ms is below the threshold at which a person notices a page responding, so the cost lands
entirely on the only party making thousands of attempts.

 * by **42 seconds**, and a 2/sec trickle grew the backlog faster than it drained, so the
 * denial outlasted the attack. Worse, the link's own 5-minute TTL is evaluated when the work
 * finally runs, so the valid token can EXPIRE while queued.
 *
 * This is the exact denial of service the no-lockout design was chosen to avoid, reintroduced
 * by the mechanism meant to prevent guessing. A depth cap turns it back into what it should
 * be: overflow is refused instantly and cheaply, while the ~16 in front still pay the full
 * slot, so the rate limit is untouched.
 *
 * **Under flood, everyone is refused — including you. That is the intended behaviour, not a
 * shortfall.** Redeeming a link *during* an attack on the endpoint is an explicit non-goal:
 * what has to hold is that brute force fails hard, and it does. There is no identity to
 * prioritise on anyway, because every request over the tunnel arrives from loopback. So the
 * cap makes the failure immediate and cheap for both sides rather than a 42-second wait, the
 * queue drains in ~1.6s once the burst stops, and the caller captures the clock on ARRIVAL so
 * queueing can never expire the very token being redeemed.
 *
 * Worth being precise about what does the security work here: **the guess rate is set by the
 * SLOT, not by the queue.** Depth changes how a flood is absorbed and nothing about how fast
 * anyone can guess — that stays at ten attempts a second, or one after ten consecutive
 * failures. The cap is a denial-of-service control; the slot is the brute-force control.

WHO MAY WRITE SOURCE.

Extracted and pure because the previous version was an inline expression inside a
closure behind a TLS-requiring `Bun.serve` — untestable in practice, and it is the
single decision standing between a tunnelled request and arbitrary repo writes (which
the watcher then rebuilds and RUNS). A decision that guards code execution must be
reachable from a test.

It also fixes a fail-OPEN. The previous rule inferred "is this request local?" from the
ABSENCE of `X-Forwarded-*`:

    proxied ? validSession(...) : isLoopbackAddress(peer)

Absence of a header is not evidence of presence at the keyboard. Any path that delivers
to loopback without setting those headers — `ssh -R` against a box with
`GatewayPorts yes`, `ngrok tcp`, `socat`, iptables DNAT, bare nginx `proxy_pass` or
HAProxy without `option forwardfor` — produced `{peer:127.0.0.1, xff:null}` for an
off-machine caller and authorized it. The safety argument rested on remote sshd
configuration the tool could not see and did not check.

So the signal is now the LISTENER the request arrived on, which is not forgeable by a
client: the dev server binds a separate loopback-only port for tunnel traffic, and
anything arriving there is treated as remote no matter what it claims.

/*
CSRF: a loopback peer is not a same-origin caller (#90).

`mayWriteSource`'s direct path is peer-address-only — no credential — and the handlers parse
JSON regardless of `Content-Type`. That makes a cross-site `fetch(…, {mode:'no-cors'})` with a
CORS-safelisted type a SIMPLE request: no preflight, peer is 127.0.0.1, gate passes. Any page
the developer happens to visit could therefore write any file under the repo root — including
`.git/hooks/*`, i.e. code execution at the next git operation. `POST /__build` then turns that
into "and run it now".

The file already claimed CSRF protection from `SameSite=Lax`, and that is true only of the
TUNNEL path, which needs a cookie. The default loopback path needs nothing, so the stated
defence never covered the primary case.

Fetch metadata is the fix, and it is cheap: browsers send `Sec-Fetch-Site` on every request and
scripts cannot forge it. A same-origin page sends `same-origin`; a page on evil.example sends
`cross-site`. Non-browser callers (our own CLI, curl) send neither header — so the rule must
accept ABSENCE, or it breaks every legitimate tool. That is not a hole: the attack this closes
is specifically "a browser the developer is using is induced to make the request", and a
browser always tells us.

Applied ONLY on the non-tunnel branch. UPSTREAM.md records that rejecting cross-site outright
breaks the tunnel case, where the widget legitimately calls :8700 from a page on :3000 — that
path is gated by a session cookie instead.

    /*
    TWO signals, because neither alone covers the population.
  
    `Sec-Fetch-Site` is the strong one — unforgeable by script, sent on every request by any
    engine that has it. But Safari < 16.4, Firefox < 90 and older WKWebViews send NO fetch
    metadata, and an earlier version of this function allowed absence outright with a comment
    claiming "a browser always sends it". That was false for exactly the browsers a developer
    might have open, leaving them in the pre-fix position: a forged simple request writing
    `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
  
    `Origin` closes that gap, because those same browsers DO send it on cross-origin POSTs. So:
    refuse a cross-site `Sec-Fetch-Site`, and independently refuse an `Origin` that is not ours.
  
    Absence of BOTH is still allowed, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight: our own
    CLI and `curl` send neither, and the threat model here is a browser being induced to make
    the request. A request carrying no browser fingerprint at all is not that.

    exactly what a sandboxed iframe, `srcdoc`, a `data:` document and a cross-origin-redirected
    POST send — i.e. the one Origin an attacker can choose. Modern engines stayed protected only
    because they ALSO send `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`; the unprotected set was precisely the
    old-browser population this Origin check exists for. Nothing we ship requests from an opaque

authorization deliberately does NOT use it (see mayWriteSource): a forwarder that omits
these headers would otherwise look local. Which listener a request arrived on is the
