 *
 * `staticDirs` is included for exactly the same reason, one bug later (#110). `buildSite`
 * COPIES those directories into the output on every build, so a replaced asset is only picked
 * up when something else happens to trigger a rebuild — re-export a GLB over `static/model.glb`
 * and the dev server keeps serving the previous copy indefinitely, with no error and no hint.
 * Both files exist and only their contents differ, which is the hardest version of stale to
 * see. The workaround people find is touching a source file to provoke a rebuild, which is a
 * strong signal the tool should be doing it.
 *
 * The built-in defaults stay for projects that declare no `docPaths`. `watchPaths` remains

 *     up-to-date project (the exact "unpinned executable fetch from library code"
 *     hazard this pin exists to bound).
 *   - HTTPS-only servers stopped advertising an HTTP port they weren't listening on.

/*
The FALLBACK channel, used only when the project has no haltija of its own.

`^1.12.6` because that is where the agent-facing fixes people upgrade for currently live;
the floor's practical job is to make bunx re-resolve rather than to express a minimum.

What 1.12.6 specifically buys a lane that spawns Electron — this floor encodes fixes, not a
date, so each of these is the reason it moved off `^1.11.2`:

  - **a `--private` instance finally has a lifetime bound** (haltija#39, filed from here). A
    SIGKILLed session, a slept laptop or a crashed harness leaves teardown un-run, and the
    only previous bound was spawner-pid polling, which cannot help when nothing runs. The
    report was a 12-day-old instance at 5.7 GB and ~150% CPU on a machine at load average
    212 — which is the incident that confounded a timing measurement here and got blamed on
    unrelated local code. It exits after 8h idle and says why; `HALTIJA_IDLE_TIMEOUT_HOURS`
    overrides. This is the single best reason to be on 1.12.6.
  - **LAN and Bonjour access work at all.** `/inject.js` handed the browser URLs built as
    `localhost:<port>`, and `localhost` in a served script means the BROWSER's machine — a
    page opened from a phone was told to connect to itself. The host is now derived from the
    request. Our TLS certs already cover `<hostname>.local` for exactly this.
  - **the widget sends `X-Haltija-Token`**, so a `--token` server and a page that can talk
    back stopped being mutually exclusive — which matters most over a tunnel.
  - **results carry `paintAgeMs`**, so "this tab says visible but is not compositing" is now
    something a caller can DETECT rather than a rule it has to remember. `visibilityState`
    means "is this tab selected", not "is it painting".
  - Electron 40.6.1 → 43.4.1, clearing two context-isolation bypasses (haltija#35). Context
    isolation is haltija's security boundary, and we spawn it.

The floor before `^1.11.2` was `^1.6.1`, and an adopter with `haltija@^1.11.2` in their own
devDependencies still got **1.11.0** — new enough to look current, old enough to lack the
fix they had just upgraded for (tosijs-ui#48).

Two things conspired, and the second is the nasty one:

  - we spawned our own channel and ignored theirs entirely, and
  - **`bunx` caches the resolution**, so a range that resolves forward does not RE-resolve
    once its cache key is populated. `^1.6.1` froze at whatever satisfied it first.

That is the stale-but-satisfying-cache hazard this project filed against haltija (#11) and
then shipped an instance of. A range is not a pin, and a cached range is not even a range.

`resolveHaltijaChannel()` below prefers the project's own installed haltija, so the version
is something an adopter controls with the tool they already use. `HALTIJA_VERSION` still
overrides everything.

Compress text-shaped assets on the way out.

The dev server serves REAL DEVICES over the LAN — that is what the mkcert cert covers
`<host>.local` for — and a doc site's bundle can be multiple MB. Everything text-shaped
here compresses to about 30%: this repo's 1.21MB iife goes to 0.39MB gzipped, 0.36MB
brotli; tosijs-3d's 10MB one goes to roughly 3MB. That is the real fix for the LAN stalls
behind #63 — raising `idleTimeout` stopped the connection dying, this stops it needing the
extra time.

Deliberately DEV-SERVER ONLY. Distribution is a host's job — Cloudflare, Firebase and
friends do this better and for free — so the build emits nothing precompressed.

Brotli at quality 5, not 11: measured on the 1.21MB iife, q5 takes 19ms for 0.36MB while
q11 takes **1169ms** for 0.32MB. Sixty times the cost for four percent.

    Fall back to the last good build while a rebuild is repopulating the tree.
  
    `buildSite` moves the output dir ASIDE (`mv docs docs.last-good`) and repopulates from
    empty, so for the length of a build every served path is simply absent. Two failures
    follow, both reported as a mysterious LAN-only stall (#63): a request that STARTS in the
    window gets a plain 404 and the page never hydrates, and a request already IN FLIGHT has
    its file vanish underneath it, so the response stops producing data and idles until
    something kills it.
  
    Measured here: continuous requests across one rebuild returned 2 non-200s, and at the
    moment of each, `docs/iife.js` was absent while `docs.last-good/iife.js` existed.
  
    Neither earlier fix touches this. Compression shortens the exposure; `idleTimeout` only
    decides how long a stalled request waits before failing — raising it actually made the
    in-flight case wait LONGER for the same failure.
  
    The fallback is self-scoping: the last-good copy is created by the stash at the start of
    a build and removed on success, so outside a build there is nothing to fall back to and
    no stale content can be served by accident. Serving one-build-old bytes for two seconds
    beats 404ing a page mid-edit.

    NOTHING the dev server serves may be cached. Ever.
  
    None of the file paths below sent `Cache-Control`, so browsers applied HEURISTIC caching —
    they are free to invent a freshness lifetime when you decline to state one, and Safari is the
    most willing to. The result is a dev server that rebuilds correctly while the browser keeps
    showing the previous build, which presents as "the fix did not work" and costs whoever is
    looking at it far more than a re-download. It cost exactly that here: a bug was reported
    against code that had already been fixed.
  
    WHY THIS IS WORSE THAN STALE PROSE, from a second sighting (tosijs-ui#129, on 1.12.0, before
    this landed): live examples are EXECUTABLE, so a stale `docs.json` runs OLD CODE against the
    NEW library. That failure is indistinguishable from a genuine library regression, and it
    survives the reload that would normally rule staleness out. It produced a confident, false
    "the library has a security bug" conclusion: a cached example fence calling a bare
    `enableAgentInterface()` was refused by the current bundle, and the refusal was correct,
    precisely worded, and described a file that no longer existed on disk. Every reading of the
    source contradicted the running page. A stale paragraph is obvious; a stale example that
    throws is a false bug report, and it cost a full working session.
  
    The intended workflow is EXPLICIT reload rather than hot reload — automatic reloads fire
    mid-thought and cost you your context. That model only works if a reload is authoritative,
    which is precisely what heuristic caching takes away.
  
    `no-store` rather than `no-cache`: no-cache still stores and revalidates, which needs
    validators we do not emit, and a dev server has nothing to gain from the round trip. The cost
    is re-fetching the bundle on a full page load — a doc site navigates client-side after that,
    and the responses are brotli/gzip compressed anyway.
  
    Deliberately NOT applied to the built output: `docs/` is a static site for a real host, and
    telling a CDN never to store it would be actively wrong. This is the dev server only.

    ── dependency audit (NON-BLOCKING — the port comes up first) ─────────────────
  
    This used to run synchronously before binding, on the argument that "the audit is
    sub-second … a gate you wait for cannot be raced."
  
    The premise was false, and measuring it is the whole story. `bun audit` against the live
    registry measured **79.5 seconds**; the guard's own `AUDIT_TIMEOUT_MS` capped that at
    **20.1s**, then gave up and failed OPEN. So the twenty-second stall on every `bun start`
    bought exactly nothing on that run — it was the cost of a check that did not happen. It
    was 20 of the 23 seconds a full build took, against a startup budget of ~5s.
  
    The race the old comment worried about is real but small, and it is bounded by reporting
    rather than by waiting: the audit result cannot retroactively un-serve a page, so the
    honest thing is to let the server come up and say something loud when the answer lands.
  
    What is deliberately NOT quieter: the finding itself. `reportAudit` stays exactly as loud
    as it was, and an advisory arriving late is prefixed so it cannot be mistaken for part of
    the startup banner it now comes after. Non-blocking must not mean easy to miss.
  
    RELEASE BUILDS STILL BLOCK. `buildSite` audits synchronously (and `--test` gates there
    too), which is where waiting is the right trade: nobody is watching a release build with
    a five-second budget, and a gate that ships is worth twenty seconds.

    we open to the local haltija channel. `hj` then talks to that same channel exactly as it does
    for a localhost page; it never learns the page is remote.
  
    The queue is not optional. The device's socket is open the moment `open()` fires, while the
    upstream connection is still being established, and a widget that says hello immediately would
    otherwise have that first frame dropped — which presents as "it attached but the agent sees
    nothing", the least debuggable possible symptom.
  
    `rejectUnauthorized: false` is scoped to this one hop: it is loopback, to a cert this machine
    minted, and the alternative is making the bridge fail on any machine whose mkcert CA is not
    installed for Bun specifically. It grants nothing a local process could not already do.

        Adoptable means DRIVABLE, not merely "the server answered".
    
        This used to adopt any server that answered `hj windows`, on the reasoning that
        `hj navigate` creates a window if there is none. That is not what happens: a server
        with `windows: []` answers fine and then `hj navigate` fails with "no browser
        reachable" — three times in one release here, each needing a manual `pkill` before
        the lane would pass. (The rule before THAT required `windows.length > 0` and raced a
        second instance; the honest signal is neither of those.)
    
        haltija >= 1.6.1 reports `ready` — server up AND a tab connected — which is exactly
        this distinction, added in response to tosijs-ui filing it (haltija#11). Older CLIs
        have no such field, so fall back to counting windows, which is closer to right than
        assuming.
    
        Declining to adopt is safe: we spawn with `-f`, which stomps the stale instance.
        */
        /*
        ALWAYS an isolated instance. Never adopt, never stomp.
    
        The lane used to reuse any reachable haltija and otherwise spawn with `-f`, which
        reclaims the shared default port and SIGTERMs whatever held it — often another
        project's session. Both halves were a problem:
    
          - adopting meant inheriting the DESKTOP app's window, whose visibility depends on
            whatever else is on screen. `hj` refuses to drive a hidden tab (rightly — a
            backgrounded tab throttles rAF, so results are plausible-but-wrong), so the lane
            failed intermittently, roughly two runs in three, with no programmatic way out.
          - `-f` made this project's test run destructive to everyone else's.
    
        `--private` gives us our own server on an EPHEMERAL port, so there is nothing to
        contend for and nothing to kill. The port is written to a file rather than guessed.
