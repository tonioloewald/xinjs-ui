 * fails — `docs.json`, `hydrate.js` and the HTML all serve 200, `<tosi-doc-system>` is
 * present in the markup, and the adopter's own `customElements.get('their-element')` returns
 * true, so the bundle looks healthy. It is inert because nothing defined `tosi-doc-system`
 * (tosijs-ui#145; cost the reporter more than any other onboarding problem).
 *
 * Checked by looking for the tag names in the built output, which survives minification
 * because `customElements.define` needs the literal string. This is the one case where
 * grepping a bundle is sound — we are looking for a STRING the runtime must contain, not for
 * a package path that minification erases.
 *
 * `liveExample` is reported separately: a corpus with no executable fences legitimately does
 * not need it, so the caller decides whether its absence is worth mentioning.
