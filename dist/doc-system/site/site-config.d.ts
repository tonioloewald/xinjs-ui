     * `import()` of the local haltija channel's `dev.js` — and spins up (or reuses)
     * a server-only HTTPS channel on port 8701. Because the loader is pulled from
     * the local server at runtime, **haltija is never bundled** (zero build bytes)
     * and self-disables off-localhost, and because injection happens at serve time
     * it never touches the built output. Local dev only; off by default. Can also

     * ### `'tunnel'` — drive a page that is NOT on this machine
     *
     * `haltijaDev: 'tunnel'` additionally serves the channel **same-origin over the tunnel**, so
     * an agent can drive a page running on a headset or a phone. This is the case the localhost
     * gate above exists to prevent, so it is a separate opt-in rather than part of `true`:
     * upgrading must never hand anyone an agent-drivable page on the internet.
     *
     * Over the tunnel every piece of it — the loader, the component, and the socket — requires a
     * **live dev session cookie**, the same credential that gates source writes, decided by the
     * same predicate (`mayDriveWithAgent`, which delegates to `mayWriteSource`). Driving a page
     * with an agent is at least as powerful as writing source, so it gets no weaker a gate.
     * Redeem a link (`tosijs-tunnel --link`) on the device first, exactly as you do to edit.
     *
     * Why same-origin: over the tunnel, `localhost` is the HEADSET. Every hardcoded
     * `https://localhost:8701` in the upstream loader points at the wrong machine, so the dev
     * server proxies the component and the WebSocket under `/__haltija/` on the page's own
     * origin instead.
     */
    /**
     * An append-only telemetry sink, so a page that is NOT on this machine can send diagnostics
     * back to whoever is driving it.
     *
     * `haltijaDev` is localhost-gated for good reason — an injected drive-my-browser channel
     * reachable from the network is RCE-adjacent — but that leaves a page served to a headset or a
     * phone with no way to say anything at all. In a WebXR session there is no console and
     * `requestAnimationFrame` is suspended, so every usual readback path is gone at once, and the
     * remaining channel is a human reading an in-scene panel aloud.
     *
     * With this on, the page POSTs to `/__debug-sink` and the server appends one line to a JSONL
     * file you can `tail -f`. The path is printed at startup.
     *
     * ```js
     * // fire-and-forget, and survives rAF suspension
     * navigator.sendBeacon('/__debug-sink', JSON.stringify({ t: Date.now(), tag, ...event }))
     * ```
     *
     * **Why this is safe off-loopback when the source endpoint is not.** It appends opaque bytes
     * to a scratch file the build never reads, outside the repo. No code runs, nothing is
     * reconfigured, and nothing it writes is ever served back. `POST /__docstore/source` is
     * remote code execution by design and stays loopback-or-session gated; this is a log.
     *
     * Bounded on purpose: bodies over 64 KB are refused and the file stops growing at 32 MB, so a
     * looping page cannot fill a disk. Off by default — `true` for the default path, or a string
     * to choose one.
