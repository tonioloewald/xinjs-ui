/*
Machine-health preflight for the doc-site build and dev server.

The memory watchdog in `dev-server.ts` bounds what THIS process does to the
machine. It is blind to what the machine is already doing — and that is where the
real damage came from: three dev servers left running from before a leak fix
landed (a running process keeps the code it loaded at launch, so updating the
package does nothing for it) grew to 103GB, 57GB and 49GB of RSS on a 32GB box.
Demand hit ~210GB against 32GB of RAM, the compressor swelled to 18GB, free
memory fell to 14MB, and the page-out scanner reclaimed zero pages. macOS's
jetsam never stepped in — it just let the box thrash for twenty minutes until it
was power-cycled.

Nothing in the build noticed, because nothing in the build ever looked. So look:
sample the process table at build start and at dev-server launch, and refuse to
add load to a machine that is already dying. Say which processes, how big, how
old, and the exact command to kill them.

Build-time only (Bun/Node APIs). Never import this from browser code.

    WASTE, not size (tosijs-ui#93 / the 1.14.0 review's F5).
  
    Every rule above asks "is one process too big?". The reported machine was 69 orphaned
    `bun build --watch` bundlers at ~194MB each — 13.09GB between them, and not one of them
    within a mile of any threshold. Dropping the `--watch` exemption made them *visible*; it did
    not make them *catchable*, and the changelog claimed otherwise.
  
    The owner's framing is the right one and is why this is not a memory rule at all:
  
      "How is an orphaned build process OK? It's wasting memory and doing nothing. I don't care
       if it 'only' uses X RAM."
      "If I bring up top or activity monitor and I see a bunch of shit with similar names on
       idle or whatever I tend to give a shit regardless of how little they're using."
  
    So the rule never consults RSS at all:
  
      ORPHANED   a watcher reparented to init (ppid 1) — its launcher is gone, so nothing will
                 ever consume its output or clean it up. One is already a defect, at any size.
  
    "A bunch with similar names" was the other candidate signal and it is NOT used, because an
    existing test encodes why: three identical `bun bin/site.ts` lines are three SIBLING PROJECTS
    each running their own dev server, which is healthy. Identical argv does not mean duplicate
    work — the distinguishing fact is the cwd, which `ps` does not give us and which
    `killStrayServer` has to shell out to `lsof` for, per process. Orphanhood catches the
    reported machine (all 69 were reparented) without that cost or that false positive.
  
    WARNS, never refuses. These are someone's stray processes, not a dying machine, and this
    guard's refusal is reserved for "do not add load to a box that is already failing". A build
    that will not start because a colleague left a watcher open is a guard people disable — and
    a disabled guard is how the machine went down twice. Named on every build with the kill
    command is the pressure that actually works.
