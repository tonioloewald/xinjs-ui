 * moment of the fatal crash, total RSS across 629 processes was ~225GB against 32GB
 * of RAM, and the box was still limping. Compression and swap mean summed footprint
 * routinely exceeds physical RAM on a perfectly healthy machine, so an aggregate-RSS
 * rule would fire during ordinary work and get switched off within a week. A SINGLE
 * process at half the machine is genuinely anomalous; the sum is not. (For a real
 * machine-level signal, see `assessMemoryPressure` below — VM pressure, not RSS
 * arithmetic.)
 *
 * Every percentage is taken against the **dev memory budget** (`memoryBudgetMb`), NOT
 * against physical RAM — see that function for why. Exempt processes (a resident LLM,
 * say) can never be offenders; they shrink the budget instead.
 *
 * - **Any process over `catastrophicPct` of the budget** (default 50%). Nothing
 *   healthy is half the available machine. Not limited to dev processes — if
 *   something else is eating the box, adding a build to it is still the wrong move.
 * - **A dev process over `hugeDevPct` of the budget** (default 25%), *regardless of
 *   age*. The age gate below is a real blind spot: the runaway that took the machine
 *   down went 0→100GB in about twenty minutes, so it spent its entire climb through
 *   the 4–16GB band both too young to be "stale" and too small to be "catastrophic" —
 *   i.e. invisible for the whole ascent. No legitimate dev process is a quarter of
 *   the available machine, young or not.
 * - **A long-lived dev process over `devLimitMb`** (default: the dev server's own RSS
 *   ceiling). Absolute, not a percentage — 4GB is too big for a dev server on any
 *   machine, and an absolute limit survives a hardware upgrade. Age-gated so a build
 *   legitimately peaking mid-run isn't flagged.
 *
 * `selfPid` is excluded throughout — this process's own growth is the memory
 * watchdog's job, and it is bounded there.
