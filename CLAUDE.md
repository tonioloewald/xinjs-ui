This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

tosijs-ui (formerly xinjs-ui) is a web-component library built on [tosijs](https://tosijs.net). Components augment HTML5/CSS3 rather than replacing native elements. The library is developed using [bun](https://bun.sh/).

## Common Commands

```bash
bun start              # Dev server at https://localhost:8787 (hot reload, reports gzip sizes) — `bun --watch bin/dev.ts`. Opens/reuses this project's browser tab (openBrowser; BROWSER=none to skip)
bun run build          # Build only (no server), exits with 0/1 — `bin/dev.ts --build-only`
bun run test-browser   # Build, launch haltija, run browser tests, exit with 0/1 — `bin/dev.ts --test`
bun run test-consumer  # Pack, install into a scratch project, run the bins, build from a foreign cwd
bun tests              # `bun test && bun playwright test` — see caveat below
bun format             # ESLint + Prettier
bun latest             # Clean install (removes node_modules + bun.lock, then bun update)
bunx tsc --noEmit      # Type check without emitting (used in CI)
bun book               # Build ePub of the doc corpus (run AFTER `bun run build`)
bun run og             # Regenerate Open Graph cards — manual, needs a RUNNING dev server (see below)
```

`bun run og` (`bin/generate-og.ts`) is a separate opt-in step, not part of the build: it drives Playwright against a **running** dev server to screenshot each page's first live example, and encodes webp via ffmpeg. Output lands in `demo/static/og/` (so it survives the build's `rm -rf docs`) and is committed like any other static asset. Re-run it only when pages or their examples change materially.

The test lanes are distinct: **`bun test`** is the fast happy-dom unit lane (hundreds of tests across ~40+ `*.test.ts` files; it recurses into `src/*/`); **`bun playwright test`** is the `tests/*.pw.ts` end-to-end lane, and **`tests/doc-tests.pw.ts` inside it runs the whole inline ` ```test ` doc tier** (including the inline-WASM guard) through Playwright — the doc-browser's background runner executes every page-with-tests in hidden iframes and resolves `window.__docTestResults`, which that spec awaits and asserts is failure-free. **This is the doc-test gate, and it runs in CI** (the e2e job's `playwright test --project=chromium` picks it up). WebKit is skipped there (its iframe runner never signals per-page completion — see TODO). **Playwright starts its own dev server** on **its own port (8799)** with the haltija overlay off — so it neither adopts nor kills the `bun start` you have on 8787.

**`bun run test-browser`** is the _interactive_ haltija lane: it drives a real haltija Electron over the same inline tests. It brings up its **own** dev server on **8798** (Playwright uses 8799), so it neither adopts nor evicts the `bun start` you have on 8787 — it used to default to 8787 and then `killStrayServer` reclaimed the port by killing whatever held it, which twice took a live tunnel offline mid-session (the tunnel survives, the server behind it does not, and the page just reports "offline"). It **reuses a running haltija if one is up — which navigates whatever window you have open** (a different project's session included), so prefer `tests/doc-tests.pw.ts` for a clean, isolated run and reach for `test-browser` only when you specifically want eyes on the real page. It is **not** the CI gate anymore; `doc-tests.pw.ts` is.

**`bun run test-consumer` is the lane that tests the package as an ADOPTER sees it** — it
`npm pack`s, installs the tarball into a throwaway project, checks every bin's shim resolves
to a file starting with a shebang, and builds a site from that project's cwd. It exists because
every other lane runs _in this repo, from this repo, with one dev server_, and four
regressions shipped from outside exactly that envelope: bins with no shebang (needs an
install), `/version.json` stamping the consumer's version (needs a foreign cwd), a
top-level `chokidar` import in shipped code (needs a consumer build), and the doc-site
hydrate bundle shipping to everyone (needs to read `npm pack`). Two consumers found three
of them within minutes of a release. More unit tests would have caught none — the gap was
never depth, it was context. It is slow (pack + install + build), so it is not part of
`bun test`; run it before every release.

**It does not execute most bins, deliberately** — only the two read-only ones in
`SAFE_TO_RUN` (`tosijs-tunnel`, `tosijs-deploy`, with `PREVIEW_HOST` scrubbed). The
regression the loop exists for is a missing shebang, which is read from the first two bytes;
running the rest would have a mandatory release lane `ssh` to the maintainer's real preview
box and `cat > /etc/caddy/Caddyfile.tpl`. The cost of that choice is that **no lane ever runs
a shipped bin's argument handling**, which is how `tosijs-release-notes --help` shipped
unrecognised (see `TODO.md`). Verify a bin's CLI surface by hand, not by assuming this lane did.

**Run every lane before a release.** CI covers only the unit lane, so any lane the release gate doesn't run _will_ rot silently — the Playwright lane sat red for ~a month before 1.7. Never scope the unit lane with a `src/*.test.ts` glob: it matches only the top-level test files and silently skips the ones in subdirectories (`src/doc-system/`, `src/live-example/`, `src/icons/`, …) — about 126 tests, including whole features' entire coverage. Bare `bun test` recurses; keep it bare.

`bun book` (`bin/build-book.ts`) reads the extracted `demo/docs.json`, so run a normal build first. Book identity/config comes from `tosijs-site.config.ts`. The doc-site build (`buildSite`) also regenerates the ePub on every build when `epub` is enabled in the site config. PDF output is the doc-browser's in-app **Print** button (`book-html.ts` → browser print-to-PDF), not a batch job.

Running a single unit test:

```bash
bun test src/make-sorter.test.ts
```

Running a single Playwright test (it starts its own dev server):

```bash
bun playwright test tests/form.pw.ts
```

### Testing Setup

- **Unit tests** (`src/*.test.ts`): Run with `bun test`. Use `happy-dom` for DOM simulation (preloaded via `bunfig.toml` → `test-setup.ts`). Import from `bun:test`.
- **Browser tests** (`bun run test-browser`): Builds the project, starts the dev server, launches [haltija](https://github.com/tonioloewald/haltija) headless browser, navigates to the demo site, waits for inline doc tests to run and POST results to `/report`, then exits with pass/fail. Uses `hj` CLI commands (`hj windows`, `hj navigate`). Uses **this project's own installed `haltija`** if there is one, falling back to `bunx haltija@^1.12.6` otherwise, and prints which at startup (`HALTIJA_VERSION` overrides both). Always spawns its OWN `--private` haltija on an ephemeral port (never adopts a running one, never reclaims the shared port — so it cannot disturb another project's session, and cannot inherit the desktop app's window). Uses the pinned `HALTIJA_PKG` (`haltija@^1.12.6`; override with `HALTIJA_VERSION`, e.g. `HALTIJA_VERSION=haltija@beta`) — the floor encodes fixes, not a date: 1.12.6 is where a `--private` instance gained a **lifetime bound** (haltija#39, filed from here after one was found 12 days old at 5.7GB on a machine at load 212), where LAN/Bonjour access started working at all (served scripts had been handing the browser `localhost`, which means the BROWSER's machine), and where results gained `paintAgeMs` — and **tears that one down on exit, Electron grandchild included**. (`kill()` on the `bunx` wrapper does not kill Electron; a survivor holds the inherited stdout open so the command _looks_ hung after it has exited, and leaves stale windows that make the NEXT run navigate a dead window and time out.) Results saved to `.browser-tests.json`.
- **Playwright tests** (`tests/*.pw.ts`): The config's `webServer` starts a dedicated dev server on port **8799** with `HALTIJA_DEV=0`, and never reuses an existing one. That isolation is deliberate: the site config sets `haltijaDev: true`, so a reused/shared server injects the haltija dev overlay, and the lane would assert against a DOM CI never sees (it also registered stale haltija windows that made `bun run test-browser` time out). Tests use `baseURL` — no hard-coded ports. Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

#### Inline doc tests

Use ` ```test ` code blocks in `/*#` doc comments for browser-based tests. See "Live example code blocks" under Documentation System for full details on how code blocks are grouped, executed, and scoped.

When an `expect()` fails the harness appends the source line and `(line N)` to the error message — e.g. `Expected false to be true | expect(x).toBe(true) (line 46)`. Line numbers refer to the test source via `//# sourceURL=inline-test`. You don't need to comment assertions out one by one to find the failure.

### Dev servers are the most dangerous thing in this repo

A dev server lives for **days** and rebuilds thousands of times, so anything it strands per rebuild compounds until the machine swaps itself to death — and macOS will _thrash rather than kill it_. This has taken the machine down **twice**. The second time, three stale servers (103GB + 57GB + 49GB of RSS on a 32GB box) had to be power-cycled away.

The load-bearing fact: **a running dev server keeps executing the code it loaded at launch.** Updating the package fixes the _next_ server you start, never the one already running. All the guards in the world are useless against a server that predates them.

- **Never call `Bun.build()` — or any native-heavy API — in a long-lived process.** Its native arena is never returned (~30MB/call, monotonic, invisible to the JS heap and to `Bun.gc()`; [oven-sh/bun#34053](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/34053), fix still unmerged). Shell out to the `bun build` CLI; the OS reclaims a child's memory on exit. Same rule for `new Bun.Transpiler()` (~40KB per _construction_ — build it once and reuse), happy-dom, and `@resvg/resvg-js`. **Measure, don't reason**: while hunting this, the leak guard I added was itself leaking twice, and the two cancelled out so the before/after numbers looked fine while nothing had improved.
- Three guards now enforce this, all in `src/doc-system/site/` — `memoryLimitMb` (RSS ceiling, exits with growth-per-rebuild), `idleTimeoutHours` (exits after 8 idle hours — bounds _how many_ servers exist, not just how big one gets), and `preflight.ts` (every build and launch reads the process table and refuses to start on a machine that is already dying). See "Not taking the machine down with you" in `src/doc-system/doc-site-system.md`.
- **Kill background dev servers before release git surgery** — otherwise one rebuilds
  mid-operation and races your greps and git commands. `pkill -f bin/dev.ts` is safe because
  it names OUR entry point; sibling projects use their own (tosijs-3d runs `bin/site.ts`), so
  it cannot reach them.

  **Do NOT "free the port" with `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill -9`.** `lsof -i:PORT` matches
  sockets whose LOCAL _or REMOTE_ port is PORT, so it returns every process merely CONNECTED —
  the browser reading the page, Playwright's browsers, a sibling project's server that happens
  to have a connection open. `killStrayServer` was rewritten to target listeners only for
  exactly this reason (see the comment in `dev-server.ts`), and that reasoning applies to
  anything you type by hand just as much as to the code.

  To find out what is actually running, ask the **build lock**, which answers by PROJECT:

  ```ts
  import { currentHolder, describeHolder } from 'tosijs-ui/site'
  currentHolder('/path/to/project') // → { pid, role, root, port } or null
  ```

  This was learned the hard way on 2026-09-01: `lsof -ti:8787` returned a sibling's
  `bun bin/site.ts`, which was concluded to be squatting our port and SIGKILLed. The lock said
  that project was on **8030** all along, exactly where its config put it. An lsof pid is not
  evidence of listening.

### Dev server compression

Text-shaped assets (`js`, `css`, `html`, `json`, `svg`, `map`, `wasm`, …) are served
**brotli or gzip** per the client's `Accept-Encoding`; already-compressed formats stream
untouched. Measured on this repo: `iife.js` 1236KB → **366KB** brotli / 396KB gzip.

Brotli runs at **quality 5, not 11** — measured, q5 is 19ms for 0.36MB while q11 is
**1169ms** for 0.32MB. Sixty times the cost for four percent.

Compressed bytes are cached, keyed on path + mtime so a rebuild invalidates them, with a
**64MB ceiling and oldest-out eviction**. The bound is not optional: this is a process that
lives for days, and an unbounded cache here is the same failure class that took the
machine down twice.

**Dev server only, deliberately.** The build emits nothing precompressed — distribution is
a host's job, and Cloudflare/Firebase do it better and for free. This exists because the
dev server serves real devices over the LAN, which is what the mkcert cert covers
`<host>.local` for; it is also the proper fix for the timeouts behind #63, where raising
`idleTimeout` stopped the connection dying and this stops it needing the extra time. The
tunnel gets it automatically — both listeners share one request handler.

### Dev Server TLS

The dev server runs HTTPS using certs in `tls/` (`key.pem` + `certificate.pem`, both gitignored). If they're missing (e.g. a fresh clone), `bin/dev.ts` exits with a message telling you to run `bun tls` (`tls/create-dev-certs.sh`) — it doesn't auto-generate, because the script runs `mkcert -install` which prompts for sudo. The script uses [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to install a locally-trusted CA, so browsers show **no** certificate warnings (unlike a bare self-signed cert). If mkcert isn't installed the script prints platform-specific install instructions and exits; install it, then re-run. Certs cover `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, and `<hostname>.local` (for LAN device testing).

### CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on push/PR to `main`, in two jobs:

- **test** — `bun install` → `bunx tsc --noEmit` → `bunx tsc -p tsconfig.bin.json` → `bun run format-check` → `bun test` (the unit lane; `bunfig.toml` roots it at the repo, so `bin/` tests are collected too).

  **Markdown is NOT formatted** (`*.md` is in `.prettierignore`, by request from tosijs).
  `proseWrap` is already `preserve`, so the only things prettier changed in a `.md` file were
  escaping literal characters (`a * literal` → `a \* literal`), padding table cells, and
  rewriting `*` bullets as `-`. The first edits the CONTENT of a document, and markdown is
  **the product** here — `src/docs/` ships as a site, an ePub and `llms.txt`. Measured before
  removing it, because it qualifies the case: the escaping is idempotent and renders
  identically through `renderDocMarkdown`, so this was churn and unwanted authority over
  prose rather than progressive corruption.

  **Why formatting is gated.** `bun format` was manual and named in no gate, so drift only ever grew — 24 unformatted files at v1.9.0, 39 by v1.9.3, 40 by v1.9.7. The cost lands on whoever runs `bun format` next: three dozen unrelated files land in their feature diff, and either they ship the churn or they spend the time separating it. Prettier is the sole formatter (ESLint carries no stylistic rules) and reaches a fixed point in one pass, so the check is deterministic and cheap. Run `bun format` before committing.

- **e2e** — generates a throwaway self-signed cert (the dev server refuses to start without one; mkcert would want sudo, and the tests already set `ignoreHTTPSErrors`), installs chromium, and runs `bunx playwright test --project=chromium`. Playwright brings up its own dev server.

The haltija doc-test lane (`bun run test-browser`) is still **not** in CI — run it locally before a release.

### Code Style

No semicolons, single quotes, 2-space indent, trailing commas (es5). Enforced by Prettier (`.prettierrc.json`). ESLint allows `any` and non-null assertions.

## Architecture

### Build Pipeline

`bin/dev.ts` orchestrates the build:

1. Writes version from `package.json` to `src/version.ts`
2. Extracts `/*#` doc comments from `src/` and `README.md` → `demo/docs.json`
3. Generates icon data via `bin/make-icon-data.js`
4. Compiles TypeScript → ESM in `dist/`
5. Generates type declarations → `dist/*.d.ts`
6. Bundles IIFE version (tosijs + marked included) → `dist/iife.js`
7. Reports gzipped bundle sizes
8. Builds demo site → `docs/`
9. Generates `llms.txt` (agent-discoverability index, shipped in the published package) via `bin/make-llms-txt.ts`

Before any of that, `buildSite` runs a **dependency-audit gate** (`src/doc-system/site/audit-guard.ts`, exported from `tosijs-ui/site`): `bun audit` on the initial build, failing on any **high+** advisory not explicitly gated. It's **on by default**, fails **open** when the audit can't run (offline), and is **not** downgraded in CI. It gates **synchronously in `buildSite`** — `bun run build`/`--test` — where a finding fails the build. **`bun start` binds the port first and audits after**, reporting loudly but never refusing to start: the audit is *not* sub-second (measured 79.5s against the live registry; `AUDIT_TIMEOUT_MS` is 20s and fails open), so blocking startup on it cost 20s and bought nothing. **Watch rebuilds never audit** (no network call in the edit loop). Findings are grouped by advisory, sorted worst-first, and annotated with the **nature** of the risk (`LEAK/ALTER` / `DoS-only` / `UNCLASSIFIED`, parsed from CVSS + CWE — annotation only). Separately, each finding is classified `runtime` / `build-only` by **reachability** (`audit-reach.ts`), and that one CAN change what blocks: `audit: { blockOn: 'runtime' }` stops a build-only advisory failing the build while still reporting it. Default is `blockOn: 'severity'` — reachability is labelling only. Sub-threshold advisories are listed compactly, plus an advisories-per-package tally as a code-smell signal. Opt out with `audit: false` / `{ mode: 'off' }` in the site config, or `TOSIJS_AUDIT=off`. Time-box an accepted risk (never silence it) with `audit: { allow: [{ advisory, reason, expires }] }` — an expired/malformed gate stops suppressing and the build fails again. Fix findings with a **minimal** targeted `overrides` pin, not a broad `bun update --latest` (e.g. `overrides: { "flatted": ">=3.4.2" }`). Full reference + due-diligence checklist: `doc-site-system.md` → "Dependency audit gate". GitHub Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) covers advisories published later against an unchanged lockfile.

The dev server watches:

- `src/` and `README.md` → triggers doc extraction + rebuild
- `demo/src/` → triggers demo rebuild only
- `icons/` → triggers icon data regeneration (`bin/make-icon-data.js` → `src/icon-data.ts`)

#### Generated files are tracked in git

`dist/`, `docs/`, `demo/docs.json`, `llms.txt`, `src/icon-data.ts`, and `src/version.ts` are build outputs but are **committed**, not gitignored. A build (`bun run build`) regenerates them, often producing large diffs in `dist/iife.js`, `dist/*.map`, `docs/*.js`, etc. — this is expected. Commit those diffs alongside the source change that caused them; do not revert or hand-edit them. Run `bun run build` before committing so the generated files match the source you're shipping.

**Rebasing/merging across generated files:** `.gitattributes` marks these paths `merge=ours` so git auto-resolves their conflicts (the next build overwrites them anyway) instead of stopping at every one. This driver is **not** stored in the repo — run it once per clone:

```bash
git config merge.ours.driver true
```

After a rebase/merge that touched generated files, run `bun run build` to regenerate them canonically, then amend/commit. Don't hand-resolve generated-file conflicts.

### Directory Structure

- `src/` - Library source code and unit tests (`*.test.ts`, recursing into subdirs)
- `src/docs/` - Hand-written markdown pages of the doc corpus (the rest is scraped from `/*#` comments)
- `tests/` - Playwright end-to-end tests (`*.pw.ts`)
- `demo/src/` - Demo site source (separate from library)
- `demo/static/` - Static assets copied to `docs/`
- `demo/docs.json` - Extracted doc corpus (generated; consumed by the site build and `bun book`)
- `dist/` - Built library output (ESM + IIFE + types)
- `docs/` - Built demo site (served at https://localhost:8787)

### Component Structure

Each component lives in `src/<component>.ts` and exports:

- A `Component` subclass (the custom element)
- An `ElementCreator` function (factory for creating instances)

New components must be added to `src/index.ts`.

> **Note**: Some files import `Component as WebComponent` — this is just an alias, not a separate class. All components extend the same tosijs `Component`.

Example pattern:

```typescript
interface WidgetParts extends PartsMap {
  button: HTMLButtonElement
  label: HTMLSpanElement
}

export class TosiWidget extends Component<WidgetParts> {
  static preferredTagName = 'tosi-widget'

  static shadowStyleSpec = {
    /* shadow DOM styles */
  }
  // static lightStyleSpec = { /* light DOM styles */ }

  static initAttributes = {
    myProperty: '',
    disabled: false,
  }

  content = () => [button({ part: 'button' }, span({ part: 'label' }, 'Click'))]

  render(): void {
    super.render()
    this.parts.label.textContent = this.myProperty
  }
}

export const tosiWidget =
  TosiWidget.elementCreator() as ElementCreator<TosiWidget>

/** @deprecated Use tosiWidget instead */
export const xinWidget = tosiWidget
```

#### The `content` property

`content` can be:

- **An array** of elements (static content): `content = [slot()]`
- **A function** returning elements: `content = () => [button({ part: 'btn' })]`
- **null** for components that build DOM programmatically in `render()`

The function form has access to `this` so it can read `initAttributes` at construction time. It also accepts `elements` as an argument: `content = ({div, span}) => [div(span('hello'))]` — though most components import element creators at the module level.

#### Parts system

Define typed parts via a `PartsMap` interface and assign `{ part: 'name' }` to elements in `content`. Access them in `render()` or methods via `this.parts.name`. **Never query the shadow DOM manually** — parts are the correct way to reference sub-elements.

#### Shadow DOM vs Light DOM slots

- Components with `shadowStyleSpec` use **shadow DOM** — use the standard `slot()` element for composition
- Components with `lightStyleSpec` use **light DOM** — use `xinSlot()` (from `elements`) which provides slot-like composition in the light DOM
- If you use `slot()` in a light DOM component, it is automatically instantiated as a `tosi-slot` element

#### Event handler binding

Methods passed as event handlers in `content` must be arrow function properties so `this` is correctly bound:

```typescript
// Correct — arrow property is auto-bound
showSettingsMenu = (): void => { ... }
content = () => [button({ onClick: this.showSettingsMenu })]

// Wrong — class method loses `this` when passed as callback
showSettingsMenu(): void { ... }
content = () => [button({ onClick: this.showSettingsMenu })]  // `this` is wrong

// Wrong — unnecessary wrapper
content = () => [button({ onClick: () => this.showSettingsMenu() })]
```

**Declaration order matters**: class fields initialize top-to-bottom. Arrow property handlers referenced in `content` must be declared **before** `content`, or they will be `undefined` when `content()` runs.

#### Content function pitfalls

- Content is called once at construction. Use `render()` for dynamic updates — toggle `hidden`, update `textContent`, call `replaceChildren()`, etc.
- Prefer a declarative `content` that defines the full element tree, with `render()` handling visibility and dynamic state. Building content imperatively (push into array based on conditionals) works but is verbose and clumsy.

**Naming convention**: All components use `Tosi*` class names, `tosi*` element creators, and `<tosi-*>` tags. Legacy `xin*` exports are simple aliases kept for backward compatibility.

### Form-Associated Components

Several components support native form integration via `static formAssociated = true`. These participate in form submission and validation automatically. Form-associated components implement:

- `name` attribute for the form field name
- `formDisabledCallback()` / `formResetCallback()` lifecycle methods
- Integration with both native `<form>` and `<tosi-form>`

To find form-associated components, grep `src/` for `formAssociated = true`.

### Code Editor (CodeMirror 6)

`<tosi-code>` (`src/code-editor.ts`) is a [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/) wrapper. The heavy CM code lives in `src/code-editor-cm.ts` and is loaded **lazily on first use** via a dynamic import.

**Never grep a minified bundle to decide what is in it.** On 2026-08-24 this file briefly claimed CodeMirror was NOT in `dist/iife.js`, "measured" by `grep -o lezer | wc -l` returning 0. That is not evidence of absence: minification erases package paths and renames identifiers, so the strings you are searching for do not survive. **Read the sourcemap** — `JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('dist/iife.js.map')).sources` — which lists every input file. It reports **21 of 110 sources** under `@codemirror/`, `@lezer/` and `code-editor-cm`. CodeMirror is in there, exactly as the paragraph below has always said.

(The related trap, since both bit in one session: `grep -c` counts _lines_, and the bundle is 275 minified lines, so it reports 1 for everything and looks like an answer.) Don't repeat the "a page with no `<tosi-code>` bundles none of it" claim without that caveat: the iife is the _most_-loaded artifact (every generated doc page, the CDN `<script>` path, and every `tosijs-ui/site` adopter that omits `bundleEntry`). `dist/code-editor-cm.js` _is_ a real ~9.5KB lazy chunk for bundler consumers.

Public surface (this is the contract; the pre-1.7 ACE `theme`/`options` props were **dropped** — breaking):

- `value` — the code; `mode` — language (`javascript`, `typescript`, `tjs`, `ajs`, `css`, `html`, `markdown`)
- `disabled` → CM `readOnly`
- `change` event fires on edits (`detail.value`)
- `editor` property exposes the underlying CM `EditorView` (undefined until loaded)
- `undo()` / `redo()` / `canUndo()` / `canRedo()` for history; `showDiff(on)` diffs `value` against a captured baseline via `tosi-diff`
- Dark mode is driven by a `highlight` Compartment + a MutationObserver on `body.darkmode`; the editor background is themed from `--code-bg` / `--text-color` via `EditorView.theme`

**tjs/ajs modes** async-load tjs-lang's CodeMirror language + completion extensions (`loadTjsExtension()` → `setLanguageExtension()`). **Critical packaging constraint:** the tjs CM extension MUST share the editor's single CodeMirror instance — a separately-loaded copy carries its own `@codemirror/state` and silently no-ops. The iife build therefore _bundles_ the tjs-lang CM extension (it's a prefix-match exclusion from `external`, keeping only the two `/browser` transpiler subpaths external). See memory / `codemirror-tjs-1.7-plan.md` for the full migration context.

### Subpath Exports & Tree-Shaking

`package.json` `exports` expose stable subpaths — `tosijs-ui/site`, `/icons`, `/code-editor`, `/live-example`, `/doc-browser`, `/diff`, `/theme` — plus a `./*` wildcard so `import 'tosijs-ui/rating'` resolves to `dist/rating.js` and registers just that element.

There is a **second `./*.js` wildcard** beside it, because `./*` alone maps `tosijs-ui/foo.js` to `dist/foo.js.js` — so the extension-ful spelling, which is exactly what an adopter copying this repo's own ESM import style would write, failed to resolve. `bin/smoke-consumer.ts` checks both spellings for a nested path (`tosijs-ui/schema-form/fields` and `…/fields.js`); nested paths only exist through the wildcards, so nothing else covers them.

**Do NOT set a blanket `sideEffects: false`.** `elementCreator()` registers custom elements _eagerly at import time_, so a bare `import 'tosijs-ui'` tree-shakes to zero registrations under it. Per-component entry points (the Lit/Shoelace model) are the correct tree-shaking path. Components that inject global styles/listeners (menu/tooltip/float) do so on **first use** (`ensureMenu`/`ensureTooltipStyles`/`ensureFloatListeners`), not at import, to keep imports side-effect-light.

**The root barrel deliberately excludes the doc-system cluster** — `code-editor`, `doc-browser`, `doc-system/doc-system`, `live-example` (#133). Because there is no `sideEffects` field (see above), a bundler must assume every `export *` target is side-effectful and cannot drop it, so those four were unconditionally eager in any app importing anything from `tosijs-ui`. Measured: the barrel alone went **1.68MB → 0.38MB** (the cluster was 77% of it), and a real 15MB React bundle saved **1.35MB / 8.9%**. They stay importable by subpath, and `src/index-iife.ts` pulls them explicitly so the doc site and CDN `<script>` users are unaffected — the weight lands on the bundle built _for_ the doc site, not on an app that imports a button. `src/index.test.ts` enforces both halves. Do not "tidy" them back into `src/index.ts`.

The trap when re-measuring, from the report: stripping `code-editor` + `live-example` + `doc-browser` measures **exactly zero change**, because `doc-system/doc-system` is an independent second door into `tjs-lang` — and it is the only one of the four not named in the `exports` map, so it is the easy one to miss.

**Never add a `browser` export condition pointing at the iife.** The iife (`dist/iife.js`) inlines tosijs + marked and is not ESM — it is for CDN `<script>` tags and naive doc-sites only, never reachable via `import`.

### Documentation System

Components are self-documenting via `/*#` comment blocks containing markdown. A JSON metadata block — `/*{ … }*/` in ts/js/css, `<!--{ … }-->` in markdown — controls nav placement and per-page head metadata (the full `Doc` type is in `src/doc-system/site/docs.ts`):

- **Nav**: `pin` (`"top"` | `"bottom"`), `order` (number, **lower first**, default 500), `parent` (a doc name/slug — this is how nav _sections_ are built, e.g. `{"pin":"bottom","parent":"Appendices"}`), `hidden`.
- **Sort order** is: pin bucket (`top` → none → `bottom`), then `order`, then title, then filename. Siblings inside a section sort the same way.
- **SEO / agent**: `title` (renames the nav item _and_ the heading), `headTitle` (the `<title>` tag only, verbatim, no project suffix), `description`, `keywords`, `image`, `noindex`.
- Markdown files may use **YAML frontmatter** instead (`title`/`order`/`author`/`date`/`draft`→`hidden`); frontmatter **wins** over the JSON block.

The `createDocBrowser()` function renders documentation from extracted `docs.json`. It supports three `routing` modes (`DocRoutingMode` in `src/doc-browser.ts`):

- `'query'` (default, legacy SPA): links are `?filename`; uses `popstate`.
- `'path'`: clean per-page `/slug/` URLs, for the static pre-rendered site.
- `'memory'`: self-contained — never reads/writes `window.history`/`location` or the `__docTestResults` global, so an embedded/nested browser can't hijack the host page's URL. Drive it via `initialRoute` + `onRouteChange` and the element's `.navigate(slug)` method.

#### Doc extraction & Markdown (`src/doc-system/site/docs.ts`, `render.ts`)

Extraction rules (learn these to avoid surprises):

- A `/*# … */` block is a doc **only when it starts a line** (whitespace-only before the `/`). A `/*#` inside a `//` comment, a string, or mid-line is NOT scraped — so don't worry about writing `/*#` in prose/comments. (Regex: `/^[ \t]*(\/\*#[\s\S]+?\*\/)/gm`.)
- Files whose name starts with `_` (`_template.md`, `_drafting-log.md`) are **skipped** — use the prefix for scaffolding/working files.
- **YAML frontmatter** (a leading `---\n…\n---`) is parsed & stripped (`parseFrontmatter`): maps `title`/`order`/`author`/`date`/`draft`(→`hidden`). Frontmatter **wins** over the JSON-comment metadata; an empty `title` falls back to the H1; a bare `---` rule is left as content.
- `renderDocMarkdown` (the ONE renderer for build + client) adds prose Markdown on top of marked, each activating **only on its own syntax** (code docs unaffected): `[[slug]]` / `[[slug|label]]` **wikilinks** → `/slug/` (not inside code spans), and `[^id]` **footnotes** → numbered refs + an endnotes `<section>`. A fence info string may carry `#id` (` ```js#my-example `) to give that live example a stable anchor.

#### Static doc-site system (`tosijs-ui/site`)

`src/doc-system/site/` (exported as `tosijs-ui/site`, with `defineSiteConfig`/`buildSite`/`devServer`) turns a project's markdown + `/*#` block comments into a **static, pre-rendered, hydrating** documentation site: one `/{slug}/index.html` per doc with real `<head>` metadata, no-JS readable, zero-flash hydration into the live `<tosi-doc-system>` browser, plus `sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt`. Output is a plain folder of static files for any static host. The canonical reference is `src/doc-system/doc-site-system.md` — read it before working on this system. Note (per memory): `devServer(config, { build })` takes the consumer's **full** build, not just `buildSite`, because `buildSite` does `rm -rf` on the output dir on watch rebuild and would otherwise drop sibling artifacts (e.g. a separate iife bundle).

**Agent-eyes-on-the-dev-page (`haltijaDev`)**: set `haltijaDev: true` in the site config (or `HALTIJA_DEV=1`) and `bun start` injects a localhost-gated one-line loader into served HTML that pulls haltija's dev-channel `dev.js` from a local server-only HTTPS channel it spins up on 8701 — so a coding agent can drive your real running page via the `hj` CLI. Injected at **serve time only** (never in the built `docs/`) and **never bundled** (runtime `import()` from the local server), so it's zero-cost and self-disables off localhost. This is the preferred way for an agent to get eyes on this project in-browser — use `hj`, not the Claude-in-Chrome extension. See doc-site-system.md → "`haltijaDev`".

#### Live example code blocks

**Consecutive** code blocks with languages `js`, `tjs`, `ts`, `html`, `css`, or `test` are grouped into a single live example by `src/live-example/insert-examples.ts`. Any non-code-block content (headings, paragraphs, etc.) between blocks breaks the group — the blocks become separate examples. (` ```typescript ` is the _display-only_ fence; ` ```ts ` is executable and goes through the tjs-lang transpiler.)

How grouping works (`insert-examples.ts`):

1. Finds all `.language-{js,tjs,ts,html,css,test}` elements not already inside a live-example
2. Groups consecutive `<pre>` siblings (checked via `nextElementSibling`)
3. Creates one `<live-example>` per group, setting `.html`, `.css`, `.test` properties — and, for a `js`/`tjs`/`ts` block, `.js` (the source) plus `.dialect` (which drives how it's transpiled). All three dialects are the _same_ slot: one executable block per example.

**Execution model** (`src/live-example/execution.ts`):

- Each code block type (`js`, `test`) runs as a **separate** `AsyncFunction` invocation
- `import { x } from 'tosijs-ui'` is rewritten to `const { x } = tosijsui` (also works for `'tosijs'` → `tosijs`). `{ named }`, `* as ns` and default forms are all supported, in **either quote style** — single-quote-only was a real trap, because Prettier normalises fenced code in `.md` to double quotes and silently turned every example into a non-running one (#141).
- `import { x } from 'tosijs'.elements` works — the `.elements` accessor is preserved after rewriting
- Variables/imports from a `js` block are NOT available in `test` blocks — each block has its own scope
- The `preview` DOM element is injected as a context variable, shared across blocks in the same example
- If execution throws, it's reported as a test failure: "example loads without error"

**Writing doc examples**:

- Use ` ```js ` (or ` ```tjs ` / ` ```ts `) for executable code, ` ```typescript ` (or any other language) for display-only code
- Each `js` block must import everything it needs — no sharing between blocks
- Consecutive html/js/css/test blocks form ONE example. Put markdown between them to create separate examples.
- **Do not put both `html` and `js` blocks for the same demo** — if an `html` block creates a `<tosi-widget>` and the `js` block also appends one, you get duplicates. Pick one approach per example.
- `test()` calls within a block run **concurrently** — combine dependent assertions into a single `test()` call
- Other examples on the page may leave elements in the DOM — use count-based assertions, not presence/absence
- Router demos must use `{ hashRouting: true }` — `navigate()` with History API `pushState` changes the URL path and breaks the doc-browser's `?filename` navigation

### Key Dependencies

See `package.json` for current versions. The notable ones:

- `@codemirror/*` (12 packages): the **only hard runtime `dependencies`** — everything else is a peer or dev dep. This is a deliberate 1.7 divergence from the shared practices' "zero runtime dependencies in core libraries" rule (CodeMirror can't be a naive optional peer: the editor, its language modes, and the tjs extension must all share one `@codemirror/state` instance). Don't "fix" it by demoting them to peers. The gate on a new runtime dep here is the printed gzip delta, not the dependency count.

  **The known cost, so it is not rediscovered as a bug (#58):** those 12 packages enter every
  consumer's lockfile and therefore their audit surface, even though the editor is lazy at the
  bundle level and its bytes never reach a page that has no `<tosi-code>`. An advisory against
  any of them can fail an adopter's gate. That is a real cost and it is accepted, because the
  alternatives are worse: optional peers turn a working component into one that silently does
  nothing until you install 12 packages, and the pre-1.7 arrangement — ACE loaded from a CDN —
  was worse on every axis at once (a runtime network dependency, no version pinning, no audit
  visibility at all, and a worse editor). Revisit if a CodeMirror advisory actually fails
  someone's build; extracting `<tosi-code>` into its own package is the exit, and it is a
  breaking change that needs a reason.

- `tosijs-schema`: JSON Schema validation for `<tosi-schema-form>`, `<tosi-crud>` and an
  editable `<tosi-table>` — an **optional peer** at `^1.8.0`. The floor is a probe result, not
  a guess: `bin/verify-schema-dep.ts` runs 17 acceptance checks against a candidate release
  (1.4.0–1.5.1 export no `inferSchema` at all; 1.8.0 is what enforces `oneOf` /
  `exclusiveMin/Max` and exports `unenforcedKeywords`, both asked for in tosijs-schema#8).

  **Nothing we ship imports it.** Validation is INJECTED — `setSchemaValidator({ validate,
inferSchema, unenforcedKeywords })`, and all three matter (omitting the third makes the form
  label validated keywords as unvalidated). Both alternatives were measured and rejected: a
  literal `import('tosijs-schema')` fails a consumer's build when the package is absent, and a
  variable specifier is left external and cannot resolve in a browser, killing validation for
  everyone. There is no third option — see `src/schema-form/validator.ts`.

  `src/schema-form/json-schema.ts` vendors the `JSONSchema` TYPE for the same reason
  (`import type` survives into emitted `.d.ts`, and TypeScript has no notion of an optional
  peer). `bun run typecheck-guards` is what stops it drifting; `tsconfig.json` excludes
  `*.test.ts`, so a compile-time assertion in a test file is otherwise never compiled.

- `tosijs`: Core component framework (peer + dev dep). **Apache-2.0 as of its 1.8.0**
  (BSD-3-Clause through 1.7.x). **tosijs-ui followed in 1.12.0** — MIT through 1.11.1, and
  everything published under MIT stays MIT. `dist/iife.js` inlines tosijs, so this package
  redistributes Apache-2.0 code and must carry its NOTICE under §4(d) regardless of our own
  licence; matching it removes the mismatch and adds the patent grant MIT does not address.
  The root `NOTICE` is shipped in `files` and covers tosijs, marked, Feather Icons and
  CodeMirror. The ESM build bundles none of them, so the redistribution obligation attaches to
  the iife and to anything built from it.

  The peer floor **encodes specific
  upstream fixes, not a date** — `^1.9.1` is required for the **agent-surface security fix**
  (1.9.0) plus the runtime deprecation cleanup that lands only in 1.9.1: before it, every page
  of every doc site logged deprecations a consumer could not act on — `xinValue…` from tosijs
  reading its own deprecated proxy property (tosijs#31), and `bindText`, whose deprecation was
  withdrawn as a category error (tosijs#33) but whose RUNTIME warning survived 1.9.0 while the
  typings already said otherwise. Verified on a from-scratch build: zero console warnings.
  Earlier floors: `^1.7.8` for tosijs#20 (the `this.parts` proxy crossing into nested component
  instances, which made "edit" on one live example open the editor in another) and tosijs#21
  (change-handler value staleness). Raise it only with a reason recorded here; `bun run test-consumer` asserts the devDep satisfies the declared
  peer range, so the two cannot drift apart silently (#57).

- `marked`: Markdown parsing (peer dep). Range is `^16.4.2 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0` — an
  explicit union of majors that were **actually tested**, not a `>=` that would claim majors
  nobody has run. The consumed surface is three things (`marked(text, options)`,
  `marked.parseInline(text)`, and the `MarkedOptions` type), which is why the majors are
  drop-in: verified byte-identical output on 16.4.2 / 17.0.6 / 18.0.9, plus a full
  unit+Playwright+doc-test run with 18 swapped in (#60, reported by snowfox). When marked 19
  lands, run that same swap before extending the union.
- `tjs-lang`: live-example transpiler (optional peer dep, lazy-loaded — a plain component consumer never pulls it in). Live examples load its **self-contained browser bundles** (`tjs-lang/browser` + `tjs-lang/browser/from-ts`; the TypeScript compiler lazy-loads from a CDN only for `ts` examples). Load order: installed peer → **same-origin** copy the doc-site build ships under `/tjs/` (via `__TJS_LOCAL_BASE`) → CDN chain (jsdelivr → unpkg → esm.sh). The version is pinned by `TJS_VERSION` in `src/live-example/code-transform.ts` — **bump it in lockstep with the dep** when upgrading. (Replaced `sucrase`, which is gone.)
- `happy-dom`: DOM simulation for unit tests (dev dep); also the ePub builder's HTML→XHTML pass. `@resvg/resvg-js`: rasterizes the generated ePub cover. Both `happy-dom` and `@resvg/resvg-js` are **optional peer deps** (`peerDependenciesMeta.optional`) as well as dev deps — an adopter building ePubs via `tosijs-ui/site` needs them installed (both are lazy-loaded with a graceful fallback + warning when absent).
- Components use custom HTML tags with `tosi-` prefix (e.g., `<tosi-select>`, `<tosi-dialog>`)
- IIFE build (`src/index-iife.ts`) bundles tosijs + marked + tosijs-ui, exposes `xinjs` and `xinjsui` globals (legacy names kept for backward compatibility; `window.xinjs` = tosijs, `window.xinjsui` = tosijs-ui)

### tosijs Observable Proxies

Use `tosi()` to create observable state. Access values via `.value` property:

```typescript
import { tosi } from 'tosijs'

// Create observable state
const { app } = tosi({
  app: {
    count: 0,
    user: { name: 'Alice' },
  },
})

// Read/write via .value
console.log(app.count.value) // 0
app.count.value = 5

// Observe changes
app.count.observe((newValue) => {
  console.log('count changed to', newValue)
})

// Nested paths work the same way
app.user.name.value = 'Bob'
```

**Key points:**

- `tosi()` returns proxies, not raw objects
- Always use `.value` to read/write actual values
- Use `.observe()` for change callbacks
- BoxedScalars work transparently except for `===` comparisons
- In bindings, `toDOM` callbacks receive the raw value, not the BoxedScalar

### List Binding Syntax Sugar

The `.listBinding` property on array proxies provides concise syntax for binding arrays to DOM:

```typescript
import { tosi, elements } from 'tosijs'

const { div, span } = elements
const { app } = tosi({
  app: {
    items: [
      { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Bob' },
    ],
  },
})

// New syntax sugar - template callback receives (elements, item)
div(
  app.items.listBinding(
    ({ span }, item) => span({ bindText: item.name }),
    { idPath: 'id' } // optional ListBindingOptions
  )
)

// Equivalent verbose syntax (still works)
div(
  { bindList: { value: app.items, idPath: 'id' } },
  template(span({ bindText: '^.name' }))
)
```

The callback receives the `elements` proxy and the item proxy, making it easier to build templates without string-based paths.

### CSS with StyleSheet and styleSpec

**Never write CSS as raw strings.** Use `StyleSheet()` with `XinStyleSheet` objects:

```typescript
import { StyleSheet, XinStyleSheet, vars, varDefault } from 'tosijs'

const myStyles: XinStyleSheet = {
  // Use vars.* for CSS variable references (generates var(--foo))
  '.my-class': {
    padding: vars.spacing,
    fontSize: vars.fontSize,
    color: vars.brandColor,
  },

  // Use vars with numeric suffixes for scaled values
  // vars.spacing50 → calc(var(--spacing) * 0.5)
  // vars.fontSize75 → calc(var(--font-size) * 0.75)
  '.compact': {
    padding: vars.spacing50,
    gap: vars.spacing25,
    fontSize: vars.fontSize75,
  },

  // Use varDefault.* for customizable defaults
  // varDefault.myColor('#f00') → var(--my-color, #f00)
  '.themed': {
    background: varDefault.widgetBg('#fff'),
    color: varDefault.widgetColor('#000'),
  },

  // Define CSS variables with underscore prefix
  // _myVar becomes --my-var in output
  '.widget': {
    _widgetState: 'active',
    background: vars.widgetState,
  },

  // Keyframes work as nested objects
  '@keyframes fade-in': {
    from: { opacity: '0' },
    to: { opacity: '1' },
  },
}

// Inject into document head with an ID
StyleSheet('my-styles', myStyles)
```

**Key points:**

- CSS is code - apply the same quality standards as TypeScript
- No magic numbers - use `vars.spacing`, `vars.fontSize`, etc.
- Use scaled variants: `vars.spacing25`, `vars.spacing50`, `vars.spacing75`, `vars.spacing200`
- Use `varDefault.foo('default')` for theme-customizable values
- Underscore prefix (`_foo`) defines CSS variables (`--foo`)
- `StyleSheet()` injects styles into `<head>` with deduplication by ID

### CSS Architecture Principles

**CSS Variables are the Way:**

- More efficient than any preprocessor or utility-class framework
- Namespace all custom properties (W3C made poor decisions, protect yourself)
- Use `vars.*` and `varDefault.*` from tosijs, never raw `var()` strings
- tosijs color math (`Color` class) polyfills incomplete CSS color function support
- Changing root variables recomputes derived values throughout the app

**Semantic Variable Naming:**
Variable names should indicate their type through natural terms:

- **Spatial**: `*-size`, `*-height`, `*-width`, `*-gap`, `*-spacing` (single value)
- **Spatial shorthand**: `*-padding`, `*-margin`, `*-inset`, `*-radius` (1-4 values)
- **Color**: `*-color`, `*-bg`, `*-fill`, `*-stroke`, or bare nouns (`--brand`, `--accent`)
- **Other**: `*-shadow`, `*-transition`, `*-opacity`, `*-weight`

**Color and Metrics are Orthogonal:**

- Keep color and sizing concerns completely separate
- A minimal set of color constants (brand, accent, maybe 1-2 more) drives all theming
- Use `currentColor` to propagate color context without explicit variables
- Dark mode = recompute colors from the same brand values, not a separate palette

**Metrics Hierarchy:**

- `font-size` is the primary driver
- `touch-size` secondary (for interactive hit targets)
- `spacing` tertiary
- Derived values (`line-height`, `border-radius`, gaps) computed from above but overridable
- Use `vars.spacing50`, `vars.fontSize75` etc. - never inline `calc()` or magic numbers

**Element Types - Fixed Terrain:**
UI is a fixed landscape wired to state, not a function that rebuilds on every change:

- **Text blocks** - inline content that flows
- **Widgets** - inline-block/flex items with consistent metrics
- **Interactive widgets** - widgets with padding (for hit area), cursor, focus states

**Layout Patterns:**

- A small set of flex patterns covers most layouts
- A small set of scrolling patterns covers scroll needs
- Text, labels, edit fields, and button captions should align on a single line by default
- Multiline text and captions should wrap equally well

**Spacing Rules:**

- An element should almost never have both padding AND margin - pick one
- Interactive elements use padding (not margin) - the padding IS the hit area
- Use `boxShadow` instead of `border` - it doesn't affect layout metrics

**Interactivity Levels:**

1. **Static** - not interactive at all
2. **Dynamic/read-only** - updates but not user-editable
3. **Clickable** - responds to clicks/taps
4. **Focusable/Editable** - can receive focus and keyboard input

### Theme System

The theme system (`src/theme.ts`) provides automatic dark mode and consistent styling:

```typescript
import { Color } from 'tosijs'
import { createTheme, createDarkTheme, applyTheme } from 'tosijs-ui'

const colors = {
  accent: Color.fromCss('#0064d2'),
  background: Color.fromCss('#ffffff'),
  text: Color.fromCss('#1a1a1a'),
}

// Auto dark mode based on preference
const prefersDark = matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches
applyTheme(prefersDark ? createDarkTheme(colors) : createTheme(colors))
```

Base variables use `--tosi-` prefix (e.g., `--tosi-spacing`, `--tosi-accent`, `--tosi-touch-size`). Components derive their own variables from these (e.g., `--tosi-select-gap` defaults to `var(--tosi-spacing-sm)`).

### Drop Menus

`popDropMenu()` extends the menu system for drag-and-drop. A single `menuItems` array serves both click navigation (`popMenu`) and drag-to-drop (`popDropMenu`).

```typescript
import { popMenu, popDropMenu, tosiMenu } from 'tosijs-ui'

const menuItems = [
  {
    caption: 'Documents',
    icon: 'folder',
    acceptsDrop: ['text/*'], // MIME types this item accepts
    dropAction(data) {
      /* ... */
    }, // called on drop
    action() {
      /* click handler */
    },
    menuItems: [
      /* children */
    ], // can be () => MenuItem[] for lazy loading
  },
]

// Click mode - shows all items
popMenu({ target, menuItems })

// Drop mode - filters/disables non-matching items
popDropMenu({ target, menuItems, dataTypes: ['text/plain'] })
```

Key options:

- `hideDisabled` (default `false`) — non-matching items shown disabled; set `true` to hide them
- `disclosureDelay` (ms, default 200) — hover time before submenu auto-discloses
- `MenuItemsProvider` — `menuItems` can be `MenuItem[]` or `() => MenuItem[]` for lazy evaluation
- `<tosi-menu accepts-drop="text/plain;text/html">` — auto-opens drop menu on compatible drag

### Drag and Drop Library

`dragAndDrop.init()` sets up global drag-and-drop handling. It automatically marks `[data-drop]` elements with `.drag-target` when a compatible drag starts, including elements added dynamically during the drag (via MutationObserver). The observer is torn down when the drag ends.

Classes managed by the library:

- `.drag-source` — element being dragged
- `.drag-target` — valid drop target for current drag
- `.drag-over` — drop target currently hovered

### Icon Composition

The icon system (introduced in 1.5.10) supports a compact composition language for combining and modifying icons inline. SVG sources live in `icons/` (subdirs `color/`, `filled/`, `stroked/`); `bin/make-icon-data.js` regenerates `src/icon-data.ts` when files there change.

The composition language uses single-character suffixes on icon names — e.g. size, fill/stroke color, x/y offset, rotation, weight — and `$` to stack multiple icons into one composite. Examples like `tool_fffF70s50x$tosi` (a tool overlaid on a person), `spin90Loader` (a rotated spinning loader), and `messageCircle80s70x_60y1W_fffF$tosiHat$glasses4y$coat$tosi` (a multi-layer composite) appear throughout the demos.

See `icons/icon-composition.md` for the full grammar — suffix codes (`o/s/r/f/x/y/F/S/W`), stacking (`$`), prefix rules, redirects, and `spin`. When working with icons, read that file first rather than guessing the syntax.

### Component Philosophy

- Work with the browser, not against it
- `value` property for state, `change` event when it changes
- `action` event for user interactions (distinct from value changes)
- Binary attributes (`hidden`, `disabled`) work as expected
- Interoperable with other web-component libraries

**Pinned-element class naming** — when a component supports pinning (sticky cells/rows), it tags the pinned elements and the boundary touching the unpinned area with parallel classes:

- Cells: `col-pinned` on every pinned column cell; `col-edge-right` on the rightmost left-pinned column (right edge of the left-pinned group), `col-edge-left` on the leftmost right-pinned column.
- Rows: `row-pinned` on every pinned row; `row-edge-bottom` on the bottom-most pinned-top row (the boundary below the pinned-top group), `row-edge-top` on the top-most pinned-bottom row.

The edge-class name describes which side of the pinned group the boundary is on, not which side of the viewport — so a new pinning context (e.g. `tab-pinned` + `tab-edge-*`) should follow the same convention.

For the consumer-facing mental model — element-creator pattern, value/change/action contract, form association, theming, localization, and a "fighting the framework" anti-pattern checklist — see `Using-Components.md` at the repo root. Read it before answering questions about how a component should be used.

## Commit annotations → CHANGELOG

Put one `[tag]` bullet in the commit **body** per separately-interesting thing. This is
the single source of truth for release notes:

```
fix(tunnel): one port resolver for server and bin

[fix] the tunnel bin derived localPort as a fixed 8788 while the server used PORT+1 —
      they agreed only when PORT was 8787. closes #39
[new] `--status` reports the ports it would use
[note] extracted resolveTunnelLocalPort so the two cannot drift again
```

`[break]` `[new]` `[fix]` `[change]` publish; `[note]` is internal and withheld.

**One bullet per thing, not one per commit.** That is the point, and the reason the
`type:` prefix alone is not enough: a commit that fixes three things has three bullets,
while a conventional-commit prefix can only represent one. Keep the conventional subject —
the two are complementary, not alternatives.

```bash
bun run release-notes    # assemble the section for the current version
bun run release-check    # gate: every annotation accounted for (exit 1 if not)
```

**Run `release-check` AFTER the release commit, not before.** The range is
`<last tag>..HEAD`, so a `[new]`/`[fix]` bullet written _in the release commit itself_ is not
in the range you checked a moment earlier — 1.11.0 shipped a commit whose body claimed the
gate was green while it exited 1 on the state that commit created. Worse, the range is
exclusive of the since-commit, so **tagging turns the gate green without the bullet ever being
written**: the annotation escapes in both directions. Re-run it as the last thing before
`git tag`, and treat its exit code as the contract — the whole point of the tool is that it is
the one thing that cannot be talked out of noticing.

**The last commit before `git tag` must carry only `[note]` bullets, or the loop does not
terminate.** Writing up commit N's annotations is itself commit N+1, which has annotations of
its own. Fold the write-up into the CHANGELOG, then land it with `[note]` only — internal
process detail is exactly what `[note]` is for, and it is the only tag the gate does not
demand prose for.

`release-check` fails when an annotation since the last tag appears nowhere in
`CHANGELOG.md`, and separately reports any commit whose `[fix]`/`[new]` bullets are
contradicted by a **markdown-only diff**. That second check is not pedantry: three entries
in the 1.9.0 notes described fixes that were never written, and the worst — an auth gate —
was asserted by a commit whose diff never touched the file it named.

The tool assembles a **skeleton**, not the prose. The sentence worth reading ("1.8.0's
site entry point does not import at all in a clean install — upgrade regardless") cannot
be derived from a diff. Write that; the gate only ensures nothing is silently dropped.

Ships as `tosijs-release-notes` so adopters get the same workflow.

## Publishing

1. Update version in `package.json` (bump **before** building — `src/version.ts` is generated from it)
2. (No need to start a dev server — every lane brings up its own now)
3. `bun run release-check` — every annotation since the last tag is written up
4. Run **all four lanes**: `bun test` → `bun run test-browser` → `bun playwright test` → `bun run test-consumer`. `bun tests` covers only two of them; a lane the gate skips rots silently.
5. `bun format` — CI now runs `bun run format-check`, so an unformatted tree fails the gate
6. Build: `bun run build` (this also runs the dependency-audit gate — a high+ advisory here fails the build; fix or time-box it before releasing, don't `TOSIJS_AUDIT=off` past it)
7. Commit changes including `dist/` and `docs/`
8. Tag release: `git tag v1.x.x`
9. Push: `git push origin main` **and** `git push origin v1.x.x` (the user publishes to npm)
10. **After the user says "published", verify the git side — npm and git diverge silently.**
    The publish is the user's action and succeeds whether or not steps 8–9 ever happened.
    1.13.0 sat on npm as `latest` with **no tag at HEAD and 21 unpushed commits** — the whole
    release line including all three remediation passes, on one machine only. Nothing
    surfaced it; it was found by chance while checking something else.

    ```bash
    npm view tosijs-ui version              # what is actually latest
    git tag --points-at HEAD; git status -sb # tagged? ahead of origin?
    npm pack tosijs-ui@<version>            # then: diff -rq <tgz>/package/dist dist
    ```

    That last check is the one that matters and it is cheap: it proves the **remediated**
    code shipped rather than an earlier build. Diff the tree — do **not** grep for a specific
    fix. Grepping `"!== 'null'"` for the CSRF exemption matched an ordinary `origin !== null`
    guard _and_ the comment recording the exemption's absence, and read as a failure against
    code that was correct.

### Prereleases — iterate on betas, gate the final

**What earns a minor.** A **breaking change** or a **feature rollout** — something announced,
documented as new capability, and worth a consumer's attention. An **additive, non-breaking
extension of an existing component** ships as a **patch**, even though it adds public API.

This is a deliberate divergence from strict semver, and from what this file said before
("a feature that adds public API is a minor, however unfinished it feels"). Two costs drove
the change. A minor carries a **review tax** — the nine-lens review before every final
`1.x.0` is ~40 minutes and dozens of agents — and paying it for a new optional property on
one component buys nothing, so the real effect was to discourage shipping the property at
all. And a version line that jumps a minor for every additive tweak reads to adopters as
**thrash**: it signals churn where there is none, and it devalues the signal for the
releases that genuinely warrant it.

The contract adopters actually get is the one that matters, and it is unchanged: **a patch
never breaks you.** Additive-only means additive-only — a new property, a new class, a new
export. The moment a change removes, renames, or alters existing behaviour it is a minor
(or a major), regardless of how small it looks.

So a big in-progress feature still ships as `1.x.0-beta.N`, not as a patch pretending to be
small. Cut betas freely — but a
prerelease published under a dist-tag is something consumers _install_, so the gate is
**all four lanes** plus `bun run build`, same as a final. `test-consumer` especially:
every packaging regression that ever reached an adopter was invisible to the other three,
and it caught a live one (an rc.2 fix that had silently never applied) on its first run.

**Run the nine-lens review (`/pre-release-review`) once, before the FINAL `1.x.0`** —
not on every beta. It costs ~40 minutes and dozens of agents; spending that per
iteration would stop you iterating, which is the opposite of what a beta line is for.

**Publish a prerelease under a dist-tag:**

```bash
bun publish --tag beta      # NOT a bare `bun publish`
```

A bare publish makes the prerelease **`latest`**, so everyone doing a fresh
`bun add tosijs-ui` gets a beta. Consumers opt in with `tosijs-ui@beta`; `latest` stays
on the last stable. (`npm dist-tag ls tosijs-ui` shows the current state.) When the
final ships, publish it normally so `latest` moves.

Kill any background `bun start` before doing release git surgery (`pkill -f bin/dev.ts`) — otherwise it rebuilds mid-operation and races the greps and git commands. Do **not** reach for `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill -9` to free the port; see the warning under "Dev servers are the most dangerous thing in this repo" for why that command kills bystanders, and use `currentHolder()` to find out what is really running.

## Task Tracking

Open tasks and planned work are tracked in `TODO.md` at the project root.

## Where the design docs live

Root-level markdown that is _not_ published to the doc site — read the relevant one before touching its subsystem, and add findings to it rather than starting a parallel document:

- `TODO.md` — open tasks and planned work (the index; start here)
- `Using-Components.md` — consumer-facing mental model for using the components
- `doc-system-roadmap.md` — north star for the doc system (library-as-endpoint)
- `codemirror-tjs-1.7-plan.md` — the ACE→CodeMirror 6 + first-class-tjs migration
- `BUILD-TJS-HOOK.md` — the `libraryBuild` / preload seams in `SiteConfig` (shipped), for consumers with native `.tjs` sources
- `UPSTREAM.md` — findings and asks filed against tjs-lang / tosijs
- `RELEASE-REVIEW-1.7.md`, `RELEASE-REVIEW-1.9.md`, `reviews-1.11-pass{1,2,3}.md` — pre-release reviews. **A finished review is a RECORD, not a gate**: mark it historical the moment its findings are dispositioned, and put the open items in `TODO.md`. 1.11.0 shipped a review file reading "Verdict: BLOCK" with 59 of 59 boxes unticked long after the blockers were fixed, which reads as an open gate and is exactly how this project twice claimed a fix a later review found still live.
- `SCHEMA-FORM-PLAN.md` — the schema-driven editing design note (built; see its status header)
- `schema-form.md` — the snowfox handover this work learned from (source + defect report)
- `REMOTE-ACCESS-PLAN.md` — the tunnel / remote-editing plan
- `import-resolver-plan.md`, `self-contained-examples-plan.md` — live-example infrastructure
- `src/doc-system/doc-site-system.md` — the canonical reference for `tosijs-ui/site`.
  **Sweep it whenever you change behaviour it documents** — it is a doc surface like any
  other, and three findings in the 1.14.0 review (F3, F4, F11) were each a guarantee that
  changed in code while this file, `CLAUDE.md` and an emitted `.d.ts` went on promising the
  old one. Grep the OLD wording, not the new: you already know the new sentence, so searching
  for it finds your own edit.
  **This one IS published** (it lives under `src/`, which is in `docPaths`), and renders at
  `/doc-site-system/`. It is listed here because you must read it before touching that
  subsystem — not because it is internal. Write it for adopters: anything you put in it goes
  to the open web, the ePub and `llms.txt`, exactly like a `/*#` doc comment.
