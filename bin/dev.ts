STOP THIS PROJECT'S dev server — by pid, from the lock it already writes.

The thing people reach for is `pkill -f 'bun bin/dev.ts'`, which matches every dev server on the
machine because every project on this pipeline runs an identical command line. A sibling
checkout or another agent's session dies to a command that reads as "restart mine", and the
victim's symptoms — a live pid with no listener — are indistinguishable from the zombie in #91,
so it costs a fresh diagnosis every time (#117).

The lock record already carried pid, port and root; it needed a reader and a command.
